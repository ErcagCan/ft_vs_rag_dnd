        "reference":"A Giant Spider is a Large beast that lives underground, building its lair on ceilings or in dark, web‑filled crevices. It can climb difficult surfaces, including upside‑down on ceilings, without needing an ability check. The spider spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands from its abdomen, using them to snare prey. When it attacks, it bites with a +5 to hit, dealing 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage and forcing a DC 11 Constitution saving throw; on a failed save the target takes 9 (2d8) poison damage. If the poison reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour and is paralyzed while poisoned. The spider can also fire a web as a ranged attack (range 30\/60 ft.) that restrains the target; the restrained creature can attempt a DC 12 Strength check to burst the web. The webbing itself has AC 10, 5 hit points, is vulnerable to fire damage, and is immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. The Giant Spider’s lair is often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims, making it a foreboding, sticky trap for any who dare enter its underground domain.",
