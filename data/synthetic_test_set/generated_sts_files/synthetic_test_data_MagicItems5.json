            "Mithral Armor\nArmor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.\n\nNecklace of Adaptation\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).\n\nNecklace of Fireballs\nWondrous item, rare This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireballspell (save DC 15).  You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.\n\nNecklace of Prayer Beads\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin) This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.  Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nd20      Bead of …      Spell                                          \n1-6      Blessing       Bless                                          \n7-12     Curing         Cure wounds (2nd level) or lesser restoration  \n13 - 16  Favor          Greater restoration                            \n17 - 18  Smiting        Branding smite                                 \n19       Summons        Planar ally                                    \n20       Wind  walking  Wind walk                                      \n\n\nNine Lives Stealer\nWeapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.\n\nOathbow\nWeapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, “Swift death to you who have\nwronged me.” The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.\nWhen you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.\nWhile your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.\n\nOil of Etherealness\nPotion, rare\nBeads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional\nvial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.\n\nOil of Sharpness\nPotion, very rare This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultra thin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.\n\nOil of Slipperiness\nPotion, uncommon This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.  Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.\n\nPearl of Power\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster) While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can`t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nPeriapt of Health\nWondrous item, uncommon You are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant.

If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion’s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.\n\nPipes of Haunting\nWondrous item, uncommon\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nPipes of the Sewers\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.\nThe pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called\nswarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.  Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’ music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours.\n\nPlate Armor of Etherealness\nArmor (plate), legendary (requires attunement) While you’re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nPortable Hole\nWondrous item, rare This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.  If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the\nportable holeor the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed\nportable holecan survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable holeinside an extradimensional space created by a\nbag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\n\nPotion of Animal Friendship\nPotion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you can cast the animal friendship\nspell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.\n\nPotion of Clairvoyance\nPotion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the\nclairvoyancespell.

This potion’s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.\n\nPotion of Giant Strength\nPotion, rarity varies When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.  This potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone giant strength have the same effect.\nType of Giant      Strength  Rarity     \nHill giant         21        Uncommon   \nFrost\/stone giant  23        Rare       \nFire giant         25        Rare       \nCloud giant        27        Very rare  \nStorm giant        29        Legendary  \n\n\nPotion of Growth\nPotion, uncommon When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the enlarge\/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\n\nPotion of Healing\nPotion, rarity varies You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion’s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion’s red liquid glimmers when agitated.\n\nPotions of Healing\nPotion of …       Rarity     HP Regained  \nHealing           Common     2d4 + 2      \nGreater healing   Uncommon   4d4 + 4      \nSuperior healing  Rare       8d4 + 8      \nSupreme healing   Very rare  10d4 + 20    \n\n\nPotion of Heroism\nPotion, rare\nFor 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour.

The potion’s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.\n\nPotion of Poison\nPotion, uncommon\nThis concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of healing\nor other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An\nidentify\nspell reveals its true nature.\nIf you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13\nConstitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.\n\nPotion of Resistance\nPotion, uncommon When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage for 1 hour.

            "Mithral Armor\nArmor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.\n\nNecklace of Adaptation\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).\n\nNecklace of Fireballs\nWondrous item, rare This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireballspell (save DC 15).  You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.\n\nNecklace of Prayer Beads\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin) This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.  Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nd20      Bead of …      Spell                                          \n1-6      Blessing       Bless                                          \n7-12     Curing         Cure wounds (2nd level) or lesser restoration  \n13 - 16  Favor          Greater restoration                            \n17 - 18  Smiting        Branding smite                                 \n19       Summons        Planar ally                                    \n20       Wind  walking  Wind walk                                      \n\n\nNine Lives Stealer\nWeapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.\n\nOathbow\nWeapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, “Swift death to you who have\nwronged me.” The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.\nWhen you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.\nWhile your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.\n\nOil of Etherealness\nPotion, rare\nBeads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate.

Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.\n\nOil of Sharpness\nPotion, very rare This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultra thin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.\n\nOil of Slipperiness\nPotion, uncommon This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.  Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.\n\nPearl of Power\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster) While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot.

If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion’s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.\n\nPipes of Haunting\nWondrous item, uncommon\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nPipes of the Sewers\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.\nThe pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called\nswarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.  Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’ music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours.\n\nPlate Armor of Etherealness\nArmor (plate), legendary (requires attunement) While you’re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nPortable Hole\nWondrous item, rare This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.  If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the\nportable holeor the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed\nportable holecan survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable holeinside an extradimensional space created by a\nbag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\n\nPotion of Animal Friendship\nPotion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you can cast the animal friendship\nspell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.\n\nPotion of Clairvoyance\nPotion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the\nclairvoyancespell.

The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.  This potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone giant strength have the same effect.\nType of Giant      Strength  Rarity     \nHill giant         21        Uncommon   \nFrost\/stone giant  23        Rare       \nFire giant         25        Rare       \nCloud giant        27        Very rare  \nStorm giant        29        Legendary  \n\n\nPotion of Growth\nPotion, uncommon When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the enlarge\/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\n\nPotion of Healing\nPotion, rarity varies You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion’s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion’s red liquid glimmers when agitated.\n\nPotions of Healing\nPotion of …       Rarity     HP Regained  \nHealing           Common     2d4 + 2      \nGreater healing   Uncommon   4d4 + 4      \nSuperior healing  Rare       8d4 + 8      \nSupreme healing   Very rare  10d4 + 20    \n\n\nPotion of Heroism\nPotion, rare\nFor 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour.

The potion’s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.\n\nPotion of Poison\nPotion, uncommon\nThis concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of healing\nor other beneficial potion.

At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw.

The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.\nWhenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.\n"

Necklace of Adaptation Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons). Necklace of Fireballs Wondrous item, rare This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireballspell (save DC 15). You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first. Necklace of Prayer Beads Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin) This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic. Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that bead can’t be used again until the next dawn. d20 Bead of … Spell 1-6 Blessing Bless 7-12 Curing Cure wounds (2nd level) or lesser restoration 13 - 16 Favor Greater restoration 17 - 18 Smiting Branding smite 19 Summons Planar ally 20 Wind walking Wind walk"
