Perfect Self Unarmored Defense Beginning at1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. Martial Arts At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield: •You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strike sand monk weapons. •You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage ofyour unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. •When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon. Ki Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: KisaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Flurry of Blows Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. Patient Defense You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Step of the Wind You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. Unarmored Movement Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. Monastic Tradition When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Deflect Missiles Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

Perfect Self Unarmored Defense Beginning at1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. Martial Arts At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield: •You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strike sand monk weapons. •You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage ofyour unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. •When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon. Ki Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: KisaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Flurry of Blows Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. Patient Defense You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Step of the Wind You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. Unarmored Movement Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. Monastic Tradition When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Deflect Missiles Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1",

Martial Archetypes Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.

        ],
        "reference":"A Monk and a Fighter approach melee combat from very different design philosophies, and the information in the two context segments shows how their core features shape that difference.\n\n**Hit Points and Proficiency**\n- A Monk starts with 8 + Constitution modifier hit points at 1st level and gains 1d8 (or 5) + Constitution modifier per level thereafter.  The Monk’s proficiency bonus follows the standard table, starting at +2 and increasing with level.\n- A Fighter also begins with 10 + Constitution modifier hit points and gains 1d10 + Constitution modifier per level.  The Fighter’s proficiency bonus is identical to the Monk’s, starting at +2.\n\n**Armor and AC**\n- The Monk’s class features explicitly state that the character wears no armor and does not wield a shield.  The Monk’s Armor Class is calculated as 10 + Dexterity modifier + Wisdom modifier (Unarmored Defense).  This means a Monk relies on Dexterity and Wisdom to keep AC high.\n- The Fighter, by contrast, is proficient with all armor and shields.  The Fighter can choose to wear chain mail, leather armor, or any other armor type, and can also use a shield.  The Fighter’s AC is therefore 10 + Dexterity modifier + armor bonus (or 10 + Dexterity modifier + shield bonus if a shield is used).  The Fighter also has the Defense fighting style, which adds +1 to AC when wearing armor.\n\n**Weapon Proficiency and Combat Style**\n- The Monk is limited to simple weapons and shortswords (monk weapons).  The Monk can use Dexterity instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes and monk weapons, and can roll a d4 (increasing with level) for the damage of those attacks.  The Monk also gains a bonus action unarmed strike when using the Attack action.\n- The Fighter is proficient with simple and martial weapons, and can choose a martial weapon and a shield or two martial weapons.  The Fighter can also use a light crossbow or handaxes.  The Fighter’s combat style options (e.g., Dueling, Two‑Weapon Fighting, Great Weapon Fighting) modify attack or damage rolls, and the Fighter can use a shield for a defensive bonus.\n\n**Movement and Mobility**\n- The Monk gains Unarmored Movement, a 10‑foot speed increase at 2nd level that grows with level.  At 9th level the Monk can move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling.\n- The Fighter does not receive a special movement bonus, but can use the Step of the Wind ki feature (Monk) or the Action Surge (Fighter) to increase movement or take extra actions.\n\n**Ki vs. Action Economy**\n- The Monk’s ki system provides a pool of points that can be spent on Flurry of Blows (two unarmed strikes as a bonus action), Patient Defense (Dodge as a bonus action), Step of the Wind (Dash or Disengage as a bonus action), and other ki features that scale with level.  Ki points are regained after a short or long rest.\n- The Fighter’s action economy is enhanced by features such as Extra Attack (starting at 5th level, increasing to four attacks at 20th level), Action Surge (one extra action per short or long rest, two at 17th level), and Second Wind (bonus action to regain hit points).  The Fighter also gains Indomitable to reroll failed saves.\n\n**Overall Effectiveness in Melee**\n- A Monk excels in speed, mobility, and the ability to strike multiple times with unarmed or monk weapons, especially when using ki to add bonus actions or to increase movement.  The Monk’s AC relies on Dexterity and Wisdom, so a high Wisdom score is crucial for survivability.\n- A Fighter relies on armor for protection, multiple attacks per action, and the ability to use a shield for defensive bonuses.  The Fighter’s action surge and extra attacks give a high damage output, while Second Wind provides a small self‑heal.\n- In a direct melee encounter, a Monk can outmaneuver a Fighter with superior speed and unarmored defense, but a Fighter can out‑damage a Monk with multiple attacks and armor protection.  The choice between the two classes depends on whether the player prefers a fast, agile, ki‑based combat style (Monk) or a heavily armored, high‑damage, action‑economy‑focused style (Fighter).",
