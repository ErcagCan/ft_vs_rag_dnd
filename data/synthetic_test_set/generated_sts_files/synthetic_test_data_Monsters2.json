Melee Weapon Attack:+8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.\nHit:8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours.

Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the couatl’s choice).\nIn a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle’s speed also becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.  A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.\nDarkness Aura (1\/Day). A 15--foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can’t penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.\n\nDemon s\n\nBalor\nHuge fiend (demon), chaotic evil\nArmor Class 19 (natural armor)\nHit Points 262 (21d12 + 126)\nSpeed 40 ft., fly 80 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT      WIS      CHA      \n26 (+8)  15 (+2)  22 (+6)  20 (+5)  16 (+3)  22 (+6)  \n\nSaving Throws Str +14, Con +12, Wis +9, Cha +12\nDamage Resistances cold, lightning; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks\nDamage Immunitiesfire, poison\nCondition Immunitiespoisoned\nSensestruesight 120 ft., passive Perception 13\nLanguagesAbyssal, telepathy 120 ft.\nChallenge19 (22,000 XP)\nDeath Throes.When the balor dies, it explodes, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
