You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic. Spellcasting Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. Wild Shape Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1\/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed. Beast Shapes Level Max. CR Limitations Example 2nd 1\/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf 4th 1\/2 No flying speed Crocodile 8th 1 - Giant eagle You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: •Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment,personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, andCharisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’sbonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them. •When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When"

Yourequipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. Druid Circle At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Timeless Body Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Beast Spells Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components. Archdruid At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape. Circle of the Land The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites. Bonus Cantrip When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. Natural Recovery Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. Circle Spells Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Nature’s Ward When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. Nature’s Sanctuary When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you.

Sacred Plants and Wood A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. Druids and the Gods Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix PH--B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples."

The spellcasting section states that a druid can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for their druid spells (see the paragraph that reads, \"You can use a druidic focus (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells\").

Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per druid level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal) Weapons: Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears Tools: Herbalism kit Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: •(a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon •(a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon •Leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus The Druid Proficiency Cantrips -Spell Slots per Spell Level- Level Bonus Features Known 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 1st +2 Druidic, Spellcasting 2 2 - - - - - - - - 2nd +2 plague, scrying Land’s Stride Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entanglespell. Nature’s Ward When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. Nature’s Sanctuary When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC.On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses.On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. Sacred Plants and Wood A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. Druids and the Gods Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix PH--B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples."

        "reference":"According to the Wild Shape rules in the first context, when a Druid reverts to normal form they return to the hit points they had before transforming. If the revert is caused by dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to the normal form. For example, taking 10 damage in animal form with only 1 hit point left causes a revert and the Druid takes 9 damage in normal form; as long as that excess damage does not reduce the normal form to 0, the Druid is not knocked unconscious. The rules also state that while in beast form the Druid cannot cast spells that require hands or speech, but they can still perform somatic and verbal components of spells they have already cast, and they retain any class features that are physically possible in the new form. Equipment handling is governed by the choice to let it fall, merge, or be worn. Worn equipment functions normally, but the GM decides if it is practical for the beast. Equipment that cannot be worn must either fall or merge; merged equipment has no effect until the Druid leaves the beast form.\n\nAt 18th level, the Druid gains the Beast Spells feature, allowing them to cast many druid spells while in any shape. They can perform somatic and verbal components in beast form, but cannot provide material components. At 20th level, the Archdruid feature lets the Druid ignore verbal and somatic components of druid spells, and also ignore material components that lack a cost and are not consumed. This means that Circle of the Land spells that normally require verbal or somatic components can be cast in beast form without those components, and material components that are free or non‑consumable can also be ignored. However, if a spell requires a material component that has a cost or is consumed, the Druid would still need to provide it, unless the equipment that would normally supply it is merged and therefore unavailable.\n\nThe Druid’s class features such as Land’s Stride, Nature’s Ward, and Nature’s Sanctuary are retained while in beast form as long as the new form is physically capable of using them. For example, Land’s Stride allows the Druid to move through non‑magical difficult terrain without extra cost, and Nature’s Ward provides immunity to poison and disease, both of which remain active in beast form. The equipment choices made at character creation—such as a wooden shield, a simple weapon, leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus—are subject to the same merge\/fall\/wear rules, so a druidic focus that is merged into the beast form cannot be used to provide a material component until the Druid leaves the form.\n\nIn summary, Wild Shape affects hit point recovery by restoring the pre‑transform hit points and carrying over excess damage, limits spellcasting to somatic and verbal components unless the Druid is an Archdruid, and requires careful consideration of equipment handling to determine whether material components can be supplied while in beast form. The Circle of the Land spells are fully usable in beast form under these rules, with component requirements waived at 20th level, but the availability of material components still depends on whether the necessary equipment is worn or merged.",

Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. Druid Circle At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Timeless Body Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Beast Spells Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components. Archdruid At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape. Circle of the Land The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites. Bonus Cantrip When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. Natural Recovery Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. Circle Spells Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells.

You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic. Spellcasting Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. Wild Shape Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1\/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed. Beast Shapes Level Max. CR Limitations Example 2nd 1\/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf 4th 1\/2 No flying speed Crocodile 8th 1 - Giant eagle You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: •Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment,personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, andCharisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’sbonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them. •When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When"

        "reference":"At 18th level a druid gains the Beast Spells feature, which lets them cast many druid spells while in any Wild Shape. The rules state that while in beast form the druid can perform the somatic and verbal components of a spell, but cannot provide material components. This means that a druid can still speak Druidic (the secret language) while in beast form, because speaking is a verbal action. The Druidic language rules say that anyone who knows Druidic automatically spots a hidden message written in it, and others can detect its presence with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but cannot decipher it without magic. Thus, a druid can leave a hidden Druidic message in beast form, and other druids will spot it instantly, while non‑druids will only notice the presence.\n\nEquipment rules for Wild Shape say that a druid may choose whether equipment falls, merges, or is worn. Equipment that merges has no effect until the druid leaves the form. Because the druid’s equipment does not change size or shape to match the beast, any gear that the beast cannot wear must either fall or merge. Therefore, while in beast form a druid cannot use a weapon or armor that the beast cannot physically hold or wear, even though the druid retains the ability to cast spells.\n\nThe ability to speak Druidic is not limited by the beast form; the rules explicitly allow verbal components in beast form. However, the druid cannot provide material components unless the beast form can hold them. The Archdruid feature at 20th level removes the need for verbal and somatic components entirely, so a 20th‑level druid could cast a spell in beast form without speaking Druidic at all.\n\nIn summary: a druid can speak Druidic while Wild‑shaped, can leave hidden messages that other druids spot instantly, can cast spells that require verbal components (but not material components unless the beast can hold them), and equipment that merges with the beast form is inert until the druid reverts.",
