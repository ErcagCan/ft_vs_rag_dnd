However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\nVizier.At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or\nother dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\nThe Void.This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A\nwishspell can’t restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.\n\nDefender\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.\n\nDemon Armor\nArmor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor’s clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.\nCurse.Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t doff it unless you are targeted by the\nremove curse\nspell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.\n\nDimensional Shackles\nWondrous item, rare You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.  You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.\n\nDragon Scale Mail\nArmor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement) Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.  While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).  Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nDragon  Resistance  Dragon  Resistance  \nBlack   Acid        Gold    Fire        \nBlue    Lightning   Green   Poison      \nBrass   Fire        Red     Fire        \nBronze  Lightning   Silver  Cold        \nCopper  Acid        White   Cold        \n\n\nDragon Slayer\nWeapon (any sword), rare You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon’s type. For the purpose of this weapon, “dragon” refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.\n\nDust of Disappearance\nWondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed\nwhen its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.\n\nDust of Dryness\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.\nSomeone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.\nAn elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nDust of Sneezing and Choking\nWondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be\ndust of disappearance, and an\nidentifyspell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.\nWhen you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The\nlesser restoration\nspell can also end the effect on a creature.\n\nDwarven Plate\nArmor (plate), very rare While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, if an effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can use your reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.\n\nDwarven Thrower\nWeapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement by a dwarf) You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.\n\nEfficient Quiver\nWondrous item, uncommon Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.  You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.\n\nEfreeti Bottle\nWondrous item, very rare This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efre eti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.  The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.\nd100                                                                                                    Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n01-10                                                                                                   The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5  rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle  loses its magic.                                                                                                                                          \n11 - 90                                                                                                 The efreeti serves you for  1 hour, doing as you  command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle,  and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can’t  be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the  bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the  \nbottle is opened a fourth time, the efre eti  escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its  magic.  \n91 - 00                                                                                                 The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for  you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or  after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.                                                                                                  \n\n\nElemental Gem\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the\nconjure elemental\nspell, and the gem’s magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.\nGem             Summoned Elemental  \nBlue sapphire   Air elemental       \nYellow diamond  Earth elemental     \nRed corundum    Fire elemental      \nEmerald         Water elemental     \n\n\nElven Chain\nArmor (chain shirt), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.\n\nEversmoking Bottle\nWondrous item, uncommon\nSmoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud’s area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.\nThe cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.\n\nEyes of Charming\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the\ncharm personspell\n(save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other.

Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.\nd100     Feather Token  d100     Feather Token  \n01 - 20  Anchor         51 - 65  Swan boat      \n21 - 35  Bird           66 - 90  Tree           \n36 - 50  Fan            91 - 00  Whip           \n\nAnchor. You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.\nBird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can’t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.\nFan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place.

However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\nVizier.At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or\nother dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\nThe Void.This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A\nwishspell can’t restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.\n\nDefender\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.\n\nDemon Armor\nArmor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal.

While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.\n\nDimensional Shackles\nWondrous item, rare You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.  You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.\n\nDragon Scale Mail\nArmor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement) Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.  While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).  Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nDragon  Resistance  Dragon  Resistance  \nBlack   Acid        Gold    Fire        \nBlue    Lightning   Green   Poison      \nBrass   Fire        Red     Fire        \nBronze  Lightning   Silver  Cold        \nCopper  Acid        White   Cold        \n\n\nDragon Slayer\nWeapon (any sword), rare You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

For the purpose of this weapon, “dragon” refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.\n\nDust of Disappearance\nWondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed\nwhen its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.\n\nDust of Dryness\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.\nSomeone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.\nAn elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nDust of Sneezing and Choking\nWondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be\ndust of disappearance, and an\nidentifyspell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.\nWhen you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The\nlesser restoration\nspell can also end the effect on a creature.\n\nDwarven Plate\nArmor (plate), very rare While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, if an effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can use your reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.\n\nDwarven Thrower\nWeapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement by a dwarf) You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.\n\nEfficient Quiver\nWondrous item, uncommon Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.  You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.\n\nEfreeti Bottle\nWondrous item, very rare This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efre eti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.  The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.\nd100                                                                                                    Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n01-10                                                                                                   The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5  rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle  loses its magic.                                                                                                                                          \n11 - 90                                                                                                 The efreeti serves you for  1 hour, doing as you  command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle,  and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can’t  be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the  bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the  \nbottle is opened a fourth time, the efre eti  escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its  magic.  \n91 - 00                                                                                                 The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for  you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or  after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.                                                                                                  \n\n\nElemental Gem\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the\nconjure elemental\nspell, and the gem’s magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.\nGem             Summoned Elemental  \nBlue sapphire   Air elemental       \nYellow diamond  Earth elemental     \nRed corundum    Fire elemental      \nEmerald         Water elemental     \n\n\nElven Chain\nArmor (chain shirt), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.\n\nEversmoking Bottle\nWondrous item, uncommon\nSmoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud’s area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.\nThe cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.\n\nEyes of Charming\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the\ncharm personspell\n(save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other.

You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.\nBird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can’t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.\nFan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place.

The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures.

The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn.

The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.

They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal. You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles."
