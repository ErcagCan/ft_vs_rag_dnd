These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.\n\nCustomizing NPCs\nThere are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.\nRacial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the Player’s Handbook.\nSpell Swaps. One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s challenge rating.\nArmor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC’s challenge rating.\nMagic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.\n\nAcolyte\nMedium humanoid (any race), any alignment\nArmor Class 10\nHit Points 9 (2d8)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT      WIS      CHA      \n10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  14 (+2)  11 (+0)  \n\nSkills Medicine +4, Religion +2\nSenses passive Perception 12\nLanguagesany one language (usually Common)\nChallenge1\/4 (50 XP)\nSpellcasting.The acolyte is a 1st--level spellcaster.

An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage’s abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.\n\nAssassin\nMedium humanoid (any race), any non--good alignment\nArmor Class 15 (studded leather)\nHit Points 78 (12d8 + 24)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT      WIS      CHA      \n11 (+0)  16 (+3)  14 (+2)  13 (+1)  11 (+0)  10 (+0)  \n\nSaving Throws Dex +6, Int +4\nSkills Acrobatics +6, Deception +3, Perception +3, Stealth +9\nDamage Resistances poison\nSenses passive Perception 13\nLanguages Thieves’ cant plus any two languages\nChallenge8 (3,900 XP)\nAssassinate.During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn.

Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.\nPirates are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation’s vessels.\n\nBandit Captain\nMedium humanoid (any race), any non--lawful alignment\nArmor Class 15 (studded leather)\nHit Points 65 (10d8 + 20)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT      WIS      CHA      \n15 (+2)  16 (+3)  14 (+2)  14 (+2)  11 (+0)  14 (+2)  \n\nSaving Throws Str +4, Dex +5, Wis +2\nSkills Athletics +4, Deception +4\nSenses passive Perception 10\nLanguages any two languages\nChallenge 2 (450 XP)\n\nActions\nMultiattack.

To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.\nMore than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain’s vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain’s colorful reputation.\n\nBerserker\nMedium humanoid (any race), any chaotic alignment\nArmor Class13 (hide armor)\nHit Points67 (9d8 + 27)\nSpeed30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT     WIS      CHA     \n16 (+3)  12 (+1)  17 (+3)  9 (−1)  11 (+0)  9 (−1)  \n\nSensespassive Perception 10\nLanguagesany one language (usually Common)\nChallenge 2 (450 XP)\nReckless.

These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.\n\nCustomizing NPCs\nThere are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.\nRacial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the Player’s Handbook.\nSpell Swaps. One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s challenge rating.\nArmor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC’s challenge rating.\nMagic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.\n\nAcolyte\nMedium humanoid (any race), any alignment\nArmor Class 10\nHit Points 9 (2d8)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT      WIS      CHA      \n10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  14 (+2)  11 (+0)  \n\nSkills Medicine +4, Religion +2\nSenses passive Perception 12\nLanguagesany one language (usually Common)\nChallenge1\/4 (50 XP)\nSpellcasting.The acolyte is a 1st--level spellcaster.

An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage’s abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.\n\nAssassin\nMedium humanoid (any race), any non--good alignment\nArmor Class 15 (studded leather)\nHit Points 78 (12d8 + 24)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT      WIS      CHA      \n11 (+0)  16 (+3)  14 (+2)  13 (+1)  11 (+0)  10 (+0)  \n\nSaving Throws Dex +6, Int +4\nSkills Acrobatics +6, Deception +3, Perception +3, Stealth +9\nDamage Resistances poison\nSenses passive Perception 13\nLanguages Thieves’ cant plus any two languages\nChallenge8 (3,900 XP)\nAssassinate.During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn.

To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.\nMore than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain’s vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain’s colorful reputation.\n\nBerserker\nMedium humanoid (any race), any chaotic alignment\nArmor Class13 (hide armor)\nHit Points67 (9d8 + 27)\nSpeed30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT     WIS      CHA     \n16 (+3)  12 (+1)  17 (+3)  9 (−1)  11 (+0)  9 (−1)  \n\nSensespassive Perception 10\nLanguagesany one language (usually Common)\nChallenge 2 (450 XP)\nReckless.
