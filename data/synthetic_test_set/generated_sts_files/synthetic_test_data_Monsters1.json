While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.\nFalse Appearance. While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.\nLight Sensitivity. While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n\nActions\nMultiattack.The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.\nBite.Melee Weapon Attack:+6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.\nHit:10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large\nor smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target’s head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.\nTail. Melee Weapon Attack:+6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature.\nHit:7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.\nMoan.Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn’t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker’s next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker’s moan for the next 24 hours\nPhantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn’t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.\nWhenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can’t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.\nA duplicate has the cloaker’s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.\n\nCockatrice\nSmall monstrosity, unaligned\nArmor Class11\nHit Points27 (6d6 + 6)\nSpeed20 ft., fly 40 ft.\nSTR     DEX      CON      INT     WIS      CHA     \n6 (−2)  12 (+1)  12 (+1)  2 (−4)  13 (+1)  5 (−3)  \n\nSenses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11\nLanguages -\nChallenge 1\/2 (100 XP)\n\nActions\nBite.Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement.

Melee Weapon Attack:+6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature.\nHit:7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.\nMoan.Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn’t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker’s next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker’s moan for the next 24 hours\nPhantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn’t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.\nWhenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can’t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.\nA duplicate has the cloaker’s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.\n\nCockatrice\nSmall monstrosity, unaligned\nArmor Class11\nHit Points27 (6d6 + 6)\nSpeed20 ft., fly 40 ft.\nSTR     DEX      CON      INT     WIS      CHA     \n6 (−2)  12 (+1)  12 (+1)  2 (−4)  13 (+1)  5 (−3)  \n\nSenses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11\nLanguages -\nChallenge 1\/2 (100 XP)\n\nActions\nBite.Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

        "reference":"A Basilisk is a medium monstrosity that is unaligned. It has an Armor Class of 15, 52 hit points (8d8 + 16), and moves at 20 feet per round. Its ability scores are Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 8 (−1), Constitution 15 (+2), Intelligence 2 (−4), Wisdom 8 (−1), and Charisma 7 (−2). It has darkvision 60 feet and a passive Perception of 9, and it speaks no languages. The creature’s challenge rating is 3, worth 700 experience points. The Basilisk’s most notable feature is its Petrifying Gaze. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the Basilisk and both can see each other, the Basilisk may force that creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, provided the Basilisk is not incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained; it must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. A successful save ends the effect immediately. If the creature fails again, it becomes fully petrified until it is freed by a greater restoration spell or other magic. A creature that is not surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the initial saving throw; if it does so, it cannot see the Basilisk until the start of its next turn, at which point it may avert again. If it looks at the Basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw. The Basilisk also has a quirk: if it sees its own reflection within 30 feet in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze. In combat, the Basilisk can also bite. Its Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that requires a +5 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage on a hit. These are the only actions listed for the Basilisk in the provided context.",
