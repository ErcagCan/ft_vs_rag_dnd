In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell’s level. However, if doing so brings the staff’s total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).\nSpells.While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability:\nconjure elemental(7 charges),\ndispel magic(3 charges), fireball(7th-level version, 7 charges),\nflaming sphere(2 charges), ice storm\n(4 charges), invisibility (2 charges), knock(2 charges),\nlightning bolt(7th-level version, 7 charges),\npasswall(5 charges), plane shift(7 charges),\ntelekinesis (5 charges), wall of fire (4 charges), or web (2 charges).  You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: arcane lock, detect magic, enlarge\/reduce, light, mage hand, or protection from evil and good.\nRetributive Strike. You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.  You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\nDistance from Origin   Damage                                  \n10 ft. away or closer  8 × the number of charges in the staff  \n11 to 20 ft. away      6 × the number of charges in the staff  \n21 to 30 ft. away      4 × the number of charges in the staff  \n\n\nStaff of the Python\nStaff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock) You can use an action to speak this staff’s command word and throw the staff on the ground within 10 feet of you. The staff becomes a giant constrictor snake under your control and acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the staff to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the snake.  On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren’t incapacitated. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.  If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.\n\nStaff of the Woodlands\nStaff, rare (requires attunement by a druid)\nThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.\nThe staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.\nSpells.You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff’s charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC:\nanimal friendship\n(1 charge), awaken(5 charges), barkskin\n(2 charges), locate animals or plants(2 charges),\nspeak with animals(1 charge), speak with plants (3 charges), or\nwall of thorns(6 charges).\nYou can also use an action to cast the pass without trace\nspell from the staff without using any charges.\nTree Form.You can use an action to plant one end of the staff in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and\nits branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by\ndetect magic. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its command word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.\n\nStaff of Thunder and Lightning\nStaff, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw,\ntaking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThunderclap. You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t deafened.\nThunder and Lightning. You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn’t expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.\n\nStaff of Withering\nStaff, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock) This staff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.  The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 2d10 necrotic damage to the target.

The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.\n\nSword of Life Stealing\nWeapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 3d6 necrotic damage, provided that the target isn’t a construct or an undead.
