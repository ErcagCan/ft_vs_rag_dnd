Magic Items
Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s capabilities in wondrous ways.

Attunement
Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that class’s spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.  Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.  Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.  An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.  A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.

Wearing and Wielding Items
Using a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding
it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.
In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn’t adjust. For example, drow-made armor might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped folk.
When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t wear boots.

Multiple Items of the Same Kind
Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can’t normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks.

Paired Items
Items that come in pairs-such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either.

Activating an Item
Activating some magic items requires a user to do something special, such as holding the item and uttering a command word. The description of each
item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation.  If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue’s Fast Hands can’t be used to activate the item.

Command Word
A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can’t be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell.

Consumables
Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.

Spells
Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item’s description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.  A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don’t have a spellcasting ability-perhaps you’re a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature-your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.

Charges
Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained.

Magic Items A-Z
Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A magic item’s description gives the item’s name, its category, its rarity, and its magical properties.

Adamantine Armor
Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon
This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you’re wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3
Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)
You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.

Amulet of Health
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is already 19 or higher.

Amulet of Proof against Detection and

Location
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While wearing this amulet, you are hidden from divination magic. You can’t be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

Amulet of the Planes
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the
plane shiftspell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.

Animated Shield
Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement) While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.

Apparatus of the Crab
Wondrous item, legendary This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.  The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:
Armor Class: 20
Hit Points: 200
Speed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren’t extended)
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.  The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.  A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.

1                                          Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus  to walk and swim.                                                                       Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus’s  speed to 0 and making it  unable to benefit from  bonuses to speed.

Side window shutters  close (two per side).                                                                                                         
4                                          Two claws  extend from  the front sides of the  apparatus.                                                                            The claws retract.                                                                                                                                  
5                                          Each extended claw  makes the following  melee weapon attack:  +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6 ) bludgeoning damage.  Each extended claw  makes the following  melee weapon attack:   +8  to hit, reach 5 ft., one  target. Hit: The target is  grappled (escape DC 15).  
6                                          The apparatus walks or  swims forward.                                                                                                The apparatus walks or  swims backward.

The rear hatch closes and seals.                                                                                                                  


Armor, +1, +2, or +3
Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2), or legendary (+3)
You have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The bonus is determined by its rarity.

Armor of Invulnerability
Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)
You have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this special action
is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Armor of Resistance
Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires attunement)
You have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.
d10  Damage Type  d10  Damage Type  
1    Acid         6    Necrotic     
2    Cold         7    Poison       
3    Fire         8    Psychic      
4    Force        9    Radiant      
5    Lightning    10   Thunder      


Armor of Vulnerability
Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement) While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.
Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).

Arrow-Catching Shield
Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement) You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.

Arrow of Slaying
Weapon (arrow), very rare An arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both arrows of dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.  Once an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.  Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

Bag of Beans
Wondrous item, rare
Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.
If you dump the bag’s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.
d100      Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
01        5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a  toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater  must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving  throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become  poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater  gains 5d6 temporary hit po ints for 1 hour.                                                                                         
02 - 10   A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry  juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s choice) 30  feet into the air for 1d12 rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
11 - 20   A treant sprouts. There’s a 50 percent chance  that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
21 - 30   An animate, immobile stone statue in your  likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against  you. If you leave it and others come near, it  describes you as the most heinous of villains and  directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If  you are on the s ame plane of existence as the  statue, it knows where you are. The statue  becomes inanimate after 24 hours.  
31 - 40   A campfire with blue flames springs forth and  burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
41 - 50   1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
51 - 60   1d4 + 8   bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever  a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or  smaller monster of the GM’s choice. The  monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears  in a puff of bright pink smoke.                                                                                                                                                   
61 - 70   A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
71 - 80   A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of  which act as randomly determined magic  potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of  the GM’s choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour.  Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30  days.                                                                                                                        
81 - 90   A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution  saving throw. On a successful save, a creature  permanently increases its lowest ability score by  1, randomly choosing among equally low scores.  On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force  damage from an internal magical explosion.  
91-99     A pyramid with a 60-- foot-- square base bursts  upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a  mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the  mummy lord’s lair, and its sarcophagus con ta ins  treasure of the GM’s choice.                                                                        
00        A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of  the GM’s choice. The top leads where the GM  chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant’s  castle, or a different plane of existence.                                                                                                    


Bag of Devouring
Wondrous item, very rare This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.  The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn’t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.  Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.  If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.

Bag of Holding
Wondrous item, uncommon This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.
Placing a bag of holdinginside an extradimensional space created by a
handy haversack
, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.

Bag of Tricks
Wondrous item, uncommon
This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.
You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object
lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag’s color.
The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.
The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.
Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn.
