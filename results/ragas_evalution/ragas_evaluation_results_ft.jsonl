{"user_input": "What does the blinded condition do?", "reference_contexts": ["Appendix PH -A: Conditions\nConditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster`s attack, or other effect. Mostconditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.  A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.  If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.  The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.\n\nBlinded\n•A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\nCharmed\n•A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.\n•The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.\n\nDeafened\n•A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.\n\nExhaustion\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long--term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.\nLevel Effect\n1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6\nDeathIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\n\nFrightened\n•A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\n•The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\n\nGrappled\n•A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and itcan’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n•The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated(see the condition).\n•The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grapple ror grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the\nthunder-wavespell.\n\nIncapacitated\n•An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.\n\nInvisible\n•Aninvisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.\n\nParalyzed\n•A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.\n•The creature automatically fails Strength andDexterity saving throws.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n•Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit ifthe attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.\n\nPetrified\n•A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Itsweight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.\n•The creature is incapacitated (see the condition),can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n•The creature automatically fails Strength andDexterity saving throws.\n•The creature has resistance to all damage.\n•The creature is immune to poison and disease,although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.\n\nPoisoned\n•A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\nProne\n•A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.\n•The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.\n•An attack roll against the creature has advantage ifthe attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.\n\nRestrained\n•A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and itcan’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.\n•The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.\n\nStunned\n•A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak onlyfalteringly.\n•The creature automatically fails Strength andDexterity saving throws.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n\nUnconscious\n•An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware ofits surroundings\n•The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.\n•The creature automatically fails Strength andDexterity saving throws.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n•Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit ifthe attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.\n\n\nAppendix PH -B: Fantasy -Historical Pantheons\nThe Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world’s ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.\n\nThe Celtic Pantheon\nIt’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.  The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.\n\nThe Greek Pantheon\nThe gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.\n\nThe Egyptian Pantheon\nThese gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at-the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe.\nThe Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.\n\nThe Norse Pantheon\nWhere the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring-this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.\nThe Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).\n\nCeltic Deities\nDeity

the\nplanes of existence. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.   Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.\n\nThe Material Plane\nThe Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.  The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.\n\nBeyond the Material\nBeyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.\n\nPlanar Travel\nWhen adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.\nTravel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.\nSpells. A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence.\nPlane shiftand\ngatecan transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision.\nEtherealnessallows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches-such as the Elemental Planes. And the\nastral projectionspell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.\n\nPortals.A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations-circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).\n\nTransitive Planes\nThe Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as\netherealnessand\nastral projectionallow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.\nThe\n\nEthereal Planeis a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the\nsee invisibility\nand true seeing spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as force cage and wall of force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.  The\nAstral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasionalbits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.\n\nInner Planes\nThe Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four\nElemental Planes-Air, Earth, Fire, and Water-form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning\nElemental Chaos.  At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.\n\nOuter Planes\nIf the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.   When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally “places” at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\nEven in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.\nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.\n\nOuter Planes\nThe planes with some element of good in their nature are called the\nUpper Planes. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the\nLower Planes. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.\n\nDemiplanes\nDemiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as\ndemiplane,or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that\nhas been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.\n\n\nAppendix MM- A: Miscellaneous Creatures\nThis appendix contains statistics for various animals, vermin, and other critters.

Mostconditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.  A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.  If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.  The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.\n\nBlinded\n•A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\nCharmed\n•A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.\n•The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.\n\nDeafened\n•A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.\n\nExhaustion\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long--term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.\nLevel Effect\n1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6\nDeathIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\n\nFrightened\n•A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\n•The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\n\nGrappled\n•A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and itcan’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n•The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated(see the condition).\n•The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grapple ror grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the\nthunder-wavespell.\n\nIncapacitated\n•An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.\n\nInvisible\n•Aninvisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.\n\nParalyzed\n•A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.\n•The creature automatically fails Strength andDexterity saving throws.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n•Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit ifthe attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.\n\nPetrified\n•A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone).

They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.\n\nThe Celtic Pantheon\nIt’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.  The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.\n\nThe Greek Pantheon\nThe gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.\n\nThe Egyptian Pantheon\nThese gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at-the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe.\nThe Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.\n\nThe Norse Pantheon\nWhere the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring-this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.\nThe Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).\n\nCeltic Deities\nDeity

the\nplanes of existence. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.   Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.\n\nThe Material Plane\nThe Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.  The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.\n\nBeyond the Material\nBeyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.\n\nPlanar Travel\nWhen adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.\nTravel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.\nSpells. A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence.\nPlane shiftand\ngatecan transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision.\nEtherealnessallows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches-such as the Elemental Planes. And the\nastral projectionspell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.\n\nPortals.A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations-circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).\n\nTransitive Planes\nThe Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as\netherealnessand\nastral projectionallow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.\nThe\n\nEthereal Planeis a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the\nsee invisibility\nand true seeing spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as force cage and wall of force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.  The\nAstral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasionalbits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.\n\nInner Planes\nThe Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four\nElemental Planes-Air, Earth, Fire, and Water-form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning\nElemental Chaos.  At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.\n\nOuter Planes\nIf the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.   When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally “places” at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\nEven in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.\nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.\n\nOuter Planes\nThe planes with some element of good in their nature are called the\nUpper Planes. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the\nLower Planes. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.\n\nDemiplanes\nDemiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as\ndemiplane,or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that\nhas been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.\n\n\nAppendix MM- A: Miscellaneous Creatures\nThis appendix contains statistics for various animals, vermin, and other critters.

{"user_input": "What does paralyzed creature do?", "reference_contexts": ["Appendix PH -A: Conditions Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster`s attack, or other effect. Mostconditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t. The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition. Blinded •A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. •Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage. Charmed •A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. •The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature. Deafened •A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing. Exhaustion Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long--term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description. Level Effect 1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6 DeathIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description. A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1. Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

{"user_input": "What are the key characteristics of the Celtic Pantheon, including its origins, how it is used in gameplay, and a list of its main deities with their alignments, domains, and symbols?", "reference_contexts": ["Appendix PH -B: Fantasy -Historical Pantheons The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world’s ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game. The Celtic Pantheon It’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being. The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere. The Greek Pantheon The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too. The Egyptian Pantheon These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at-the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe. The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning. The Norse Pantheon Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring-this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse. The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).

These deities, often associated with elements of the natural world, war, and the afterlife, provide a rich framework for character creation, adventure design, and world-building in fantasy settings.\n\n**Origins:**  \nThe Celtic Pantheon originates from the polytheistic beliefs of the Celtic peoples, who inhabited regions of Europe, particularly the British Isles and Gaul. Their religion was deeply intertwined with nature, the cycles of life and death, and the supernatural. Deities were often linked to natural phenomena, such as the sun, earth, and forests, as well as to human endeavors like war, craftsmanship, and poetry. In D&D, these deities are sometimes incorporated into the world’s religious and magical systems, especially in settings like the Forgotten Realms, where they may be reimagined or adapted to fit the game’s lore.\n\n**Gameplay Use:**  \nIn D&D, the Celtic Pantheon is used to define the alignments, domains, and roles of clerics, druids, and other divine spellcasters. Each deity’s portfolio influences the abilities and themes of their followers. For example, a cleric of Lugh might gain powers related to war and light, while a druid of Brigid might focus on healing and nature. The pantheon also provides inspiration for adventure hooks, such as quests to appease gods, retrieve sacred relics, or protect holy sites.

These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.\n\nCustomizing NPCs\nThere are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.\nRacial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the Player’s Handbook.\nSpell Swaps. One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s challenge rating.\nArmor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC’s challenge rating.\nMagic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.\n\nAcolyte\nMedium humanoid (any race), any alignment\nArmor Class 10\nHit Points 9 (2d8)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT      WIS      CHA      \n10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  14 (+2)  11 (+0)  \n\nSkills Medicine +4, Religion +2\nSenses passive Perception 12\nLanguagesany one language (usually Common)\nChallenge1/4 (50 XP)\nSpellcasting.The acolyte is a 1st--level spellcaster.

An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage’s abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.\n\nAssassin\nMedium humanoid (any race), any non--good alignment\nArmor Class 15 (studded leather)\nHit Points 78 (12d8 + 24)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT      WIS      CHA      \n11 (+0)  16 (+3)  14 (+2)  13 (+1)  11 (+0)  10 (+0)  \n\nSaving Throws Dex +6, Int +4\nSkills Acrobatics +6, Deception +3, Perception +3, Stealth +9\nDamage Resistances poison\nSenses passive Perception 13\nLanguages Thieves’ cant plus any two languages\nChallenge8 (3,900 XP)\nAssassinate.During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn.

To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.\nMore than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy.

You can substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s challenge rating.\nArmor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC’s challenge rating.\nMagic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.\n\nAcolyte\nMedium humanoid (any race), any alignment\nArmor Class 10\nHit Points 9 (2d8)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT      WIS      CHA      \n10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  14 (+2)  11 (+0)  \n\nSkills Medicine +4, Religion +2\nSenses passive Perception 12\nLanguagesany one language (usually Common)\nChallenge1/4 (50 XP)\nSpellcasting.The acolyte is a 1st--level spellcaster.

Here’s a breakdown of its key features, mechanics, and combat role in Dungeons & Dragons:\n\n---\n\n### **Stats and Mechanics**\n- **Armor Class**: 11 (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points**: 11 (2d8 + 2)\n- **Speed**: 60 feet\n- **Type**: Beast (Large)\n- **Challenge Rating**: 1/4 (50 XP)\n\n---\n\n### **Combat Abilities**\n1. **Trampling Charge** (Recharge 5–6):  \n   - The warhorse charges at a target within 60 feet, knocking it prone. If the target is a **creature**, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and take 13 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.  \n   - If the target is **larger than a Medium creature**, the warhorse must be within 5 feet of it to use this ability.  \n   - The warhorse can only use this ability once per turn.\n\n2. **Actions**:  \n   - **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack. *Hit:* 1d6 piercing damage.  \n   - **Hoof Strike**: Melee Weapon Attack. *Hit:* 1d6 bludgeoning damage.\n\n---\n\n### **Combat Role and Tactics**\n- **Charging**: The warhorse’s **Trampling Charge** is its defining combat ability. It allows it to dominate the battlefield by pushing enemies back or breaking through enemy lines. This is especially effective against groups of small or medium creatures.\n- **Mobility**: With a speed of 60 feet, the warhorse is fast and agile, making it ideal for flanking or repositioning during combat.\n- **Durability**: Its high Constitution (14) and 11 hit points make it resilient, though it is not immune to damage. It can absorb hits while its rider or allies focus on enemies.\n- **Tanking**: The warhorse can act as a shield for its rider, absorbing damage and using its trampling charge to break enemy formations.\n\n---\n\n### **Special Features**\n- **Trampling Charge** is the warhorse’s only special ability. It is not magical, but its raw power and size make it a formidable combatant.\n- **No Magic or Resilience**: Warhorses lack magical abilities or resistances beyond their natural armor and Constitution.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Use a Warhorse in Combat**\n1. **Positioning**: Use the warhorse to control the battlefield. Its trampling charge can push enemies into corners or force them to retreat.\n2. **Support Role**: The warhorse can protect its rider by absorbing damage or using its charge to disrupt enemy formations.\n3. **Flanking**: Pair the warhorse with a companion (e.g., a knight or paladin) to flank enemies, increasing the chances of hitting and dealing damage.\n4. **Area Control**: Use the trampling charge to prevent enemies from advancing or to break through dense groups of enemies.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nA warhorse is a durable, fast, and powerful steed with a single but devastating ability: **Trampling Charge**. Its role in combat is to control the battlefield, protect its rider, and deal area damage.

{"user_input": "What hapens if a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway?", "reference_contexts": ["Space A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them. A creature’sspace also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one. Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one. Squeezing into a Smaller Space A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space. Actions in Combat When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure. Attack The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists. With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “"], "response": "A Medium hobgoblin occupies a 5-foot by 5-foot space. A 5-foot-wide doorway is exactly the width of the hobgoblin, so the creature can stand in the doorway without issue—its body would block the passage, but it wouldn’t be physically trapped or restricted by the doorway’s dimensions.

{"user_input": "What effect does taking the Dodge action have on attacks against you?", "reference_contexts": ["Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks. Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action. Cast a Spell Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. Dash When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash. Disengage If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. Dodge When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix PH-A) or if your speed drops to 0. Help You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage. Hide When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section. Ready Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn. First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.” When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round. When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken. Search When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check. Use an Object You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn. Making an Attack Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure. 1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack’srange: a creature, an object, or a location. 2. Determine modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target.In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll. 3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead ofdamage.If there’s ever any question whether somethingyou’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack."], "response": "quad\n</think>\n\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus intently on avoiding attacks.

{"user_input": "How does the d20 function in determining attack outcomes during combat, and what special results can it produce?", "reference_contexts": ["Attack Rolls When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block. Modifiersto the Roll When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block. Ability Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule. Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster. Proficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell. Rolling 1 or 20 Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. Unseen Attackers and Targets Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness. When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly. When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden-both unseen and unheard-when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses. Ranged Attacks When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack. Range You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range. Ranged Attacks in Close Combat Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated. Melee Attacks Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack. Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions. Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 +your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Opportunity Attacks In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack. You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach. You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy. Two-Weapon Fighting When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it. Grappling When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able"], "response": "In Dungeons & Dragons, the d20 (20-sided die) is the primary tool for resolving attacks, skill checks, and other actions that involve uncertainty. During combat, when a character makes an attack, they roll a d20 and add relevant modifiers (such as ability scores, proficiency, and situational bonuses). The result determines whether the attack hits or misses based on the target's Armor Class (AC). A **natural 20** (rolling a 20) is a **critical hit**, meaning the attack hits and deals double damage. A **natural 1** (rolling a 1) is a **critical miss**, meaning the attack misses and may have additional consequences, such as a forced save or a failed skill check. These special results add drama and unpredictability to combat.", "reference": "When you make an attack, you roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. If the d20 roll is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC, which is called a critical hit.

Thetarget of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix PH-A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required). Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check. Moving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you. Contests in Combat Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others. Shoving a Creature Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you. Cover Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover. A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend. A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk. A target with total covercan’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle."], "response": "A portcullis provides **half cover** (PHB, p. 194). When a target has half cover, the attacker must roll a d20 and have a result of 11 or higher to hit the target.

This is the same cover bonus as provided by a **tree trunk**, **low wall**, or **other similar obstacle** (PHB, p. 194).

{"user_input": "In a fantasy campaign setting, how can I weave the concept of Healing into my narrative to enrich lore, add flavor, and creatively use the rules around hit points and damage, while staying true to the mechanics described in the context?", "reference_contexts": ["Damage and Healing Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireballspell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures. Hit Points Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile. A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing. Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points. Damage Rolls Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage. When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier-the same modifier used for the attack roll-to the damage. A spelltells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one targetat the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireballor a cleric casts flame strike, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast. Critical Hits When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once. For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well. Targets A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below). Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise. A Clear Path to the Target To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover. If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction. Targeting Yourself If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself."], "response": "To weave healing into your campaign's narrative, consider the following approaches that enrich lore, add flavor, and creatively use the rules around hit points and damage:\n\n### 1. **Thematic Integration: The Cost of Healing**\n   - **Lore:** Frame healing as a sacred or dangerous act tied to the world's magic system. For example, a deity of life might require a ritual involving rare materials or a sacrifice (e.g., a memory, a fragment of a character’s soul, or a life force drawn from a companion). This adds moral weight to healing decisions.\n   - **Rules:** Use the *Healing Word* or *Cure Wounds* spells as limited resources (e.g., daily uses tied to a character’s alignment or class feature). If healing is rare, players might prioritize preserving allies or face consequences like permanent injuries or curses.\n\n### 2. **Hit Points as a Measure of Vitality**\n   - **Lore:** Tie hit points to a character’s *stamina* or *essence* rather than a number. A character with low hit points might be described as \"exhausted\" or \"haunted by lingering wounds,\" prompting roleplay about their resilience or vulnerability.\n   - **Rules:** Use the *Stabilize* action (from *Player’s Handbook*) to emphasize the tension between death and survival. If a character is reduced to 0 hit points, they might fall into a coma or be possessed by a spirit, adding narrative stakes to combat.\n\n### 3. **Flavor-Driven Healing Mechanics**\n   - **Lore:** Introduce non-magical healing methods, such as herbalism, alchemy, or divine blessings. A region’s lore could revolve around a \"Spring of Renewal\" that only heals those who have atoned for past sins.\n   - **Rules:** Design homebrew mechanics, like *Soulbinding* (a spell that requires a companion’s life force to heal a target) or *Scarred Resilience* (a feat that lets a character gain temporary hit points from scars sustained in battle).\n\n### 4. **Consequences of Over-Reliance on Healing**\n   - **Lore:** If healing is too easy, it might corrupt the world. For example, a plague of undead could arise from overuse of resurrection magic, forcing players to confront the moral cost of saving lives.\n   - **Rules:** Limit resurrection spells (e.g., *Raise Dead* requires a rare component, or the caster loses a level). This ensures players weigh risks and rewards, deepening the narrative.\n\n### 5. **Healing as a Plot Device**\n   - **Lore:** A cursed character might require a specific healing ritual (e.g., a quest to retrieve a sacred relic or a moral trial). This ties healing to the story, making it a driving force for the party’s actions.\n   - **Rules:** Use the *Rest* mechanic to emphasize recovery, but add twists (e.g., a *Haunted Rest* that inflicts damage if the character’s past haunts them).\n\nBy weaving healing into the lore and mechanics, you create a world where recovery is meaningful, resourceful, and thematically rich.", "reference": "Healing restores a creature’s current hit points, which represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck.

Unarmored Defense While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. Reckless Attack Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation.

If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. Persistent Rage Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. Indomitable Might Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

Spellcasting Focus You can use a musical instrument (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. Bardic Inspiration You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

College of Lore Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic. The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another.

{"user_input": "Calc passiv checks?", "reference_contexts": ["Passive Checks\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\nHere’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a\nscore.\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.  The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.\n\nWorking Together\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.  A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\n\nGroup Checks\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.  To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.  Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\n\nUsing Each Ability\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\n\nStrength\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\n\nStrength Checks\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\nAthletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:\n•You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff,avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.\n•You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.\n•You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\nOther Strength Checks. The GM might also call fora Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door\n•Break free of bonds\n•Push through a tunnel that is too small\n•Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it\n•Tip over a statue\n•Keep a boulder from rolling\n\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\n\nLifting and Carrying\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\n\nCarrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength\nscore multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough\nthat most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.\nPush, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\nSize and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\n\nVariant: Encumbrance\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.   If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are\nencumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.  If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead\nheavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\n\nDexterity\nDexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\n\nDexterity Checks\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\nAcrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\nSleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.\nStealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip\naway without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\nOther Dexterity Checks. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent\n•Steer a chariot around a tight turn\n•Pick a lock\n•Disable a trap\n•Securely tie up a prisoner\n•Wriggle free of bonds\n•Play a stringed instrument\n•Craft a small or detailed object\n\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\n\nArmor Class\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\n\nInitiative\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.\n\nHiding\nThe GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\nYou can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.\nAn invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a\ncreature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.\nPassive Perception.When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st--level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\nWhat Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be\nlightlyor\nheavily obscured, as explained in \"The Environment.”\n\nConstitution\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\n\nConstitution Checks\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.  The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Hold your breath\n•March or labor for hours without rest\n•Go without sleep\n•Survive without food or water\n•Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go\n\nHit Points\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.  If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\n\nIntelligence\nIntelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.\n\nIntelligence Checks\nAn Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\n\nArcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\nHistory. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\nInvestigation. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nNature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\nReligion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures\nyour ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\nOther Intelligence Checks. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Communicate with a creature without using words\n•Estimate the value of a precious item\n•Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard\n•Forge a document\n•Recall lore about a craft or trade\n•Win a game of skill\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nWizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nWisdom\nWisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.\n\nWisdom Checks\nA Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\nAnimal Handling. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\nInsight. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\nMedicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\nPerception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\nSurvival. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\nOther Wisdom Checks. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow\n•Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nClerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nCharisma\nCharisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.\n\nCharisma Checks\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\n\nDeception. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception\ncan encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\n\nIntimidation. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\n\nPerformance. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\n\nPersuasion. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include\nconvincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\nOther Charisma Checks. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors,and gossip\n•Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nSaving Throws\nA saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm. To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw. A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM. Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\n\nTime\nIn situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of\nminutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.  In a city or wilderness, a scale of\nhours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.  For long journeys, a scale of\ndays works best. Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.  In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on\nrounds, a 6-second span of time.\n\nMovement\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.  The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.”  Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.\n\nSpeed\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\nTravel Pace\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\nForced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix PH-A).\nMounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a\ncarpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n\nTravel Pace\nPace                         \nDistance Traveled per . . .  \nMinute                       Hour       Day       Effect     \nFast                         400  feet  4  miles  30  miles  − 5 penalty to passiv e Wisdom (Perception) scores  \nNormal                       300  feet  3  miles  24  miles  -                                                   \nSlow                         200  feet  2  miles  18  miles  Able to use stealth                                 \n"], "response": "Passive checks in Dungeons & Dragons are used when a character is trying to perform a skill or ability check without an active roll, such as in situations where the DM doesn't want to roll for the character. The formula for calculating a passive check is:\n\n**Passive Check = 10 + Character's Ability Modifier (or other applicable modifier)**\n\nIf the character has a proficiency bonus in the relevant skill, it is added to the passive check. For example, a character with a +3 modifier in Arcana would have a passive check of **10 + 3 = 13**. If the character is proficient in Arcana, the proficiency bonus (e.g., +3) is added: **10 + 3 (modifier) + 3 (proficiency) = 16**.\n\nPassive checks are typically used for skills like Perception, where the character is constantly on alert for something. The DM sets a target number, and if the passive check meets or exceeds it, the character succeeds.", "reference": "A passive check equals 10 plus all normal modifiers that apply to the check. If the character has advantage, add 5; if disadvantage, subtract 5. The resulting total is called the passive check score. For example, a 1st‑level character with a Wisdom of 15 (+2) and proficiency in Perception (+2) has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 (10 + 2 + 2).", "answer_relevancy": 0.696947895480717, "semantic_similarity": 0.7860124910964956, "bleu_score": 0.026102284059947495, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.244131455399061, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.17218543046357615, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.41935483870967744}
{"user_input": "How can I use the Time rules to add flvour to my campaign?", "reference_contexts": ["Passive Checks\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\nHere’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a\nscore.\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.  The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.\n\nWorking Together\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.  A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\n\nGroup Checks\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.  To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.  Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\n\nUsing Each Ability\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\n\nStrength\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\n\nStrength Checks\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\nAthletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:\n•You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff,avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.\n•You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.\n•You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\nOther Strength Checks. The GM might also call fora Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door\n•Break free of bonds\n•Push through a tunnel that is too small\n•Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it\n•Tip over a statue\n•Keep a boulder from rolling\n\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\n\nLifting and Carrying\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\n\nCarrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength\nscore multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough\nthat most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.\nPush, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\nSize and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\n\nVariant: Encumbrance\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.   If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are\nencumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.  If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead\nheavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\n\nDexterity\nDexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\n\nDexterity Checks\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\nAcrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\nSleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.\nStealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip\naway without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\nOther Dexterity Checks. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent\n•Steer a chariot around a tight turn\n•Pick a lock\n•Disable a trap\n•Securely tie up a prisoner\n•Wriggle free of bonds\n•Play a stringed instrument\n•Craft a small or detailed object\n\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\n\nArmor Class\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\n\nInitiative\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.\n\nHiding\nThe GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\nYou can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.\nAn invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a\ncreature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.\nPassive Perception.When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st--level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\nWhat Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be\nlightlyor\nheavily obscured, as explained in \"The Environment.”\n\nConstitution\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\n\nConstitution Checks\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.  The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Hold your breath\n•March or labor for hours without rest\n•Go without sleep\n•Survive without food or water\n•Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go\n\nHit Points\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.  If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\n\nIntelligence\nIntelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.\n\nIntelligence Checks\nAn Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\n\nArcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\nHistory. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\nInvestigation. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nNature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\nReligion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures\nyour ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\nOther Intelligence Checks. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Communicate with a creature without using words\n•Estimate the value of a precious item\n•Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard\n•Forge a document\n•Recall lore about a craft or trade\n•Win a game of skill\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nWizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nWisdom\nWisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.\n\nWisdom Checks\nA Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\nAnimal Handling. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\nInsight. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\nMedicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\nPerception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\nSurvival. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\nOther Wisdom Checks. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow\n•Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nClerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nCharisma\nCharisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.\n\nCharisma Checks\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\n\nDeception. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception\ncan encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\n\nIntimidation. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\n\nPerformance. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\n\nPersuasion. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include\nconvincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\nOther Charisma Checks. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors,and gossip\n•Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nSaving Throws\nA saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm. To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw. A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM. Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\n\nTime\nIn situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of\nminutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.  In a city or wilderness, a scale of\nhours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.  For long journeys, a scale of\ndays works best. Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.  In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on\nrounds, a 6-second span of time.\n\nMovement\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.  The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.”  Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.\n\nSpeed\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\nTravel Pace\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\nForced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix PH-A).\nMounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a\ncarpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n\nTravel Pace\nPace                         \nDistance Traveled per . . .  \nMinute                       Hour       Day       Effect     \nFast                         400  feet  4  miles  30  miles  − 5 penalty to passiv e Wisdom (Perception) scores  \nNormal                       300  feet  3  miles  24  miles  -                                                   \nSlow                         200  feet  2  miles  18  miles  Able to use stealth                                 \n"], "response": "quad\n\n</think>\n\nThe Time rules in Dungeons & Dragons are a great way to add flavor, tension, and realism to your campaign. Here are several ways you can use them to enhance your game:\n\n1. **Time Limits on Quests**: Use the Time rules to impose deadlines on quests. For example, a magical artifact might only be safe to retrieve for a short period, or a village might be under threat from an advancing army that will reach them within a certain number of days. This can create urgency and make players think more strategically about how they spend their time.\n\n2. **Time-Sensitive Events**: Introduce events that are time-sensitive, such as a festival that only happens once a year, or a celestial alignment that will only occur again in a decade. This can create unique opportunities and challenges for the party.\n\n3. **Tracking Progress**: Use the Time rules to track the party's progress through a long campaign. For example, if the party is on a journey that takes several months, you can track how much time has passed and what has happened in the world around them. This can help create a sense of progression and change.\n\n4. **Time Travel and Paradoxes**: If your campaign involves time travel, use the Time rules to handle the mechanics of time travel and its consequences. This can add a layer of complexity and intrigue to your story.\n\n5. **Time-Based Challenges**: Design challenges that are based on time, such as a puzzle that must be solved before a certain time limit, or a combat encounter that has a time limit. This can add a new dimension to your encounters and make them more engaging.\n\n6. **NPC Interactions**: Use the Time rules to track how long NPCs have been waiting for the party, or how long it has been since a particular event. This can add depth to your NPCs and make them more realistic.\n\n7. **Weather and Seasons**: Use the Time rules to track the passage of time and how it affects the world around the party. For example, a blizzard might only last for a few days, or a drought might have been going on for several months. This can create environmental challenges and opportunities.\n\n8. **Character Development**: Use the Time rules to track how long characters have been away from their homes or how long they have been on a particular quest. This can add depth to your characters and their relationships with the world around them.\n\nBy using the Time rules creatively, you can add depth, tension, and realism to your campaign, making it more engaging for your players.", "reference": "In the rules, the GM decides the time a task requires.

{"user_input": "what is passive checks and how calculate score no roll?", "reference_contexts": ["Passive Checks A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster. Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check: 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score. For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14. The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules. Working Together Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action. A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help. Group Checks When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t. To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards."], "response": "Passive checks are used when a character is not actively trying to do something but is still making an attempt, such as perceiving something without actively searching. They are calculated using the character's ability score, proficiency bonus, and any modifiers.

Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. Divine Domain Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. Domain Spells Each domain has a list of spells-its domain spells-that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. Channel Divinity At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

Here’s how it works and its implications for spell preparation and divine energy:\n\n### 1. **Spell Save DC**  \nA cleric’s spell save DC is calculated as:  \n**8 + proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier**.  \nThis DC determines the difficulty of saving throws against the cleric’s spells (e.g., *Sacred Flame*, *Flame Strike*). A higher DC increases the likelihood that targets will fail their saves, making the cleric’s spells more effective. As the cleric gains levels and improves their proficiency bonus, their spells become increasingly difficult to resist.\n\n### 2. **Attack Modifier for Spell Attacks**  \nFor spells that require attack rolls (e.g., *Sacred Flame*, *Word of Radiance*), the cleric adds their **proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier** to the attack roll. A higher proficiency bonus (and Wisdom modifier) improves the chance of hitting targets, increasing the spell’s effectiveness in combat.\n\n### 3. **Spell Preparation**  \nClerics prepare spells from the Cleric spell list, with the number of spells they can prepare per day depending on their level and Wisdom modifier. While the proficiency bonus does not directly affect spell preparation, the Wisdom modifier (which contributes to both spell DC and attack rolls) indirectly influences how many spells they can prepare, as higher Wisdom allows for more spells.\n\n### 4. **Channeling Divine Energy**  \nDivine energy, the source of clerics’ spells and abilities, is tied to Wisdom. The proficiency bonus is not directly part of divine energy itself, but the Wisdom modifier (which enhances spell DC and attack rolls) ensures that clerics can channel their divine power more effectively. Higher Wisdom and proficiency bonuses make their spells and abilities more potent.\n\n### Summary  \nThe **proficiency bonus** is central to the cleric’s spellcasting effectiveness, influencing both the **spell save DC** and **attack modifier**.

A high Constitution means the cleric can withstand more punishment, allowing them to stay in the fight longer and support their allies more effectively. This resilience is especially important for clerics who serve as healers or frontline defenders, as they often need to endure enemy attacks while maintaining their role. A low Constitution, on the other hand, may make the cleric more vulnerable, forcing them to rely on magic, tactics, or roleplay to survive and contribute meaningfully.\n\n**Saving Throws and Survival:**  \nConstitution is one of the clerics' primary saving throw abilities, particularly against effects like poison, disease, and exhaustion. A strong Constitution modifier ensures the cleric can resist these threats, which is crucial in encounters involving environmental hazards, curses, or prolonged combat. This mechanical resilience reinforces their narrative presence as a character who can endure hardship and persevere through adversity.\n\n**Narrative Presence and Roleplay:**  \nIn storytelling, a high Constitution can be reflected in the cleric's demeanor—steadfast, unshaken, and capable of enduring both physical and emotional trials. This trait can be woven into their character's background, such as a warrior who has survived countless battles or a monk who has trained their body and mind to resist fatigue. Conversely, a low Constitution might make the cleric more susceptible to stress, fatigue, or injury, which can be explored in their roleplay, such as a character who relies on divine power to compensate for their physical frailty.\n\n**Endurance and Moral Fortitude:**  \nConstitution also symbolizes a character's endurance, which can extend beyond the physical to include mental and moral resilience. A cleric with a high Constitution may be portrayed as unwavering in their faith, unshaken by fear or despair, and capable of enduring long journeys or moral dilemmas. This can enhance their narrative presence, making them a pillar of strength for the party.", "reference": "A cleric's Constitution modifier directly adds to their hit points, giving them 8 + modifier at first level and 1d8 + modifier per level thereafter, thereby affecting their durability in combat.", "answer_relevancy": 0.8413630180688347, "semantic_similarity": 0.3717063837571917, "bleu_score": 0.09296138824460778, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.07567567567567568, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.041176470588235294, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.4666666666666667}

For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. Divine Domain Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. Channel Divinity At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required."], "response": "The Wisdom stat of a Cleric is a core component of their class, influencing multiple aspects of their abilities:\n\n1. **Spell Preparation**: While the number of spells a Cleric can prepare is determined by their level and the class's spellcasting table, Wisdom indirectly affects the power of those spells. Higher Wisdom increases the effectiveness of spells through their saving throw DC and spell attack modifiers, even if it doesn’t directly increase the number of spells prepared.\n\n2. **Spell DC**: A Cleric’s spell save DC is calculated as **8 + proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier**. A higher Wisdom modifier increases this DC, making it harder for enemies to resist a Cleric’s spells. This directly ties Wisdom to the difficulty of saving throws against their magic.\n\n3. **Turn Undead**: The effectiveness of Turn Undead is based on the Cleric’s level and Wisdom modifier. The DC for the Turn Undead effect is the same as the spell save DC, and the number of undead turned is **3 + Cleric’s level + Wisdom modifier**. Thus, higher Wisdom increases both the DC and the number of undead affected.\n\n4. **Interrelation with Spellcasting and Channel Divinity**: Wisdom is the Cleric’s spellcasting ability, which affects all spellcasting mechanics, including spell attacks, saving throws, and spell DC. Channel Divinity, a powerful class feature, also relies on Wisdom. For example, abilities like *Sacred Flame* and *Inflict Wounds* (from the *Life Domain*) use Wisdom as the ability modifier, and *Turn Undead* is a Channel Divinity use that directly depends on Wisdom.\n\nIn summary, Wisdom shapes the Cleric’s spellcasting by increasing the effectiveness of their spells and the power of their Channel Divinity abilities, while also enhancing their ability to turn undead.

In addition, the Turn Undead feature requires a Wisdom saving throw from each undead that can see or hear the cleric; if the creature fails, it is turned.

{"user_input": "how many spell slots a wizard can use before rest and how do they get them back?", "reference_contexts": ["Damage Types\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.  The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\nAcid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage.\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.\nFire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\n\nDamage Resistance and\n\nVulnerability\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\nIf a creature or an object has\nresistanceto a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has\nvulnerabilityto a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers\nto damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved,\nso the creature takes 10 damage.\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\n\nHealing\nUnless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a\ncure woundsspell or a potion of healing\ncan remove damage in an instant.\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\nA creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the\nrevivifyspell has restored it to life.\n\nDropping to 0 Hit Points\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\n\nInstant Death\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.  For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\n\nFalling Unconscious\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix PH-A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\n\nDeath Saving Throws\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.  Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\n\nStabilizing a Creature\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.  You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nA\nstablecreature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\n\nMonsters and Death\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\n\nKnocking a Creature Out\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\n\nTemporary Hit Points\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\nHealing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed\nat you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.  Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.\n\nMounted Combat\nA knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.   A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.\n\nMounting and Di smounting\nOnce during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.  If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.  If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.\n\nControlling a Mount\nWhile you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently. You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\nIn either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the\nmount.\n\nUnderwater Combat\nWhen adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.\nWhen making a\nmelee weapon attack, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.\nA\nranged weapon attackautomatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).\nCreatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.\n\n\nSpellcasting\nMagic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.  This section provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.\n\nWhat Is a Spell?\nA spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in most cases, all in the span of seconds.  Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix PH-A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.  Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.\n\nSpell Level\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.  Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\n\nKnown and Prepared Spells\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\nIn every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.\n\nSpell Slots\nRegardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\nWhen a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level\nslot. So when Umara casts magic missile,a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.\nSome characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\n\nCasting a Spell at a Higher Level\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts\nmagic missileusing one of her 2nd-level slots, that\nmagic missileis 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\nSome spells, such as magic missileand cure wounds\n, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.\n\nCasting in Armor\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n\nCantrips\nA cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.\n\nRituals\nCertain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.  To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.\n\nCasting a Spell\nWhen a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.  Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.\n\nCasting T ime\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\n\nBonus Action\nA spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\n\nReactions\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\n\nLonger Casting Times\nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\n\nRange\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like\nmagic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like\nfireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the\nshieldspell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.\nSpells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect”).\nOnce a spell is cast,its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.\n\nComponents\nA spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.\n\nVerbal (V)\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the\nsilencespell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.\n\nSomatic (S)\nSpellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell\nrequires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\n\nMaterial (M)\nCasting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a\ncomponent pouch or a\nspellcasting focus (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.  If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.  A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\n\nDuration\nA spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\n\nInstantaneous\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n\nConcentration\nSome spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.  If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).  Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n•\nCasting another spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.\n•\nTaking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\n•\nBeing incapacitated or killed.You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\n"], "response": "A wizard can use spell slots equal to the number listed for their level in the \"Spell Slots\" table on page 114 of the *Player's Handbook*. For example, a 5th-level wizard has four 1st-level spell slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. These spell slots are consumed when the wizard casts spells; each spell of a certain level uses one of the appropriate slots.\n\nSpell slots are regained through **short rests** and **long rests**:\n- **Short Rest (1 hour):** Regains a number of spell slots equal to half the wizard's level, rounded up (e.g., a 5th-level wizard regains 3 spell slots). This restores spell slots up to the number available at their current level (e.g., 3 slots for a 5th-level wizard, but not more than the total listed for that level).\n- **Long Rest (8 hours):** Regains all spell slots.

{"user_input": "What movement cost and risks are involved when a character mounts or dismounts a creature during combat?", "reference_contexts": ["Damage Types\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.  The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\nAcid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage.\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.\nFire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\n\nDamage Resistance and\n\nVulnerability\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\nIf a creature or an object has\nresistanceto a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has\nvulnerabilityto a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers\nto damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved,\nso the creature takes 10 damage.\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\n\nHealing\nUnless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a\ncure woundsspell or a potion of healing\ncan remove damage in an instant.\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\nA creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the\nrevivifyspell has restored it to life.\n\nDropping to 0 Hit Points\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\n\nInstant Death\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.  For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\n\nFalling Unconscious\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix PH-A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\n\nDeath Saving Throws\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.  Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\n\nStabilizing a Creature\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.  You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nA\nstablecreature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\n\nMonsters and Death\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\n\nKnocking a Creature Out\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\n\nTemporary Hit Points\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\nHealing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed\nat you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.  Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.\n\nMounted Combat\nA knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.   A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.\n\nMounting and Di smounting\nOnce during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.  If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.  If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.\n\nControlling a Mount\nWhile you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently. You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\nIn either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the\nmount.\n\nUnderwater Combat\nWhen adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.\nWhen making a\nmelee weapon attack, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.\nA\nranged weapon attackautomatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).\nCreatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.\n\n\nSpellcasting\nMagic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.  This section provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.\n\nWhat Is a Spell?\nA spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in most cases, all in the span of seconds.  Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix PH-A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.  Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.\n\nSpell Level\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.  Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\n\nKnown and Prepared Spells\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\nIn every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.\n\nSpell Slots\nRegardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\nWhen a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level\nslot. So when Umara casts magic missile,a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.\nSome characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\n\nCasting a Spell at a Higher Level\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts\nmagic missileusing one of her 2nd-level slots, that\nmagic missileis 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\nSome spells, such as magic missileand cure wounds\n, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.\n\nCasting in Armor\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n\nCantrips\nA cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.\n\nRituals\nCertain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.  To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.\n\nCasting a Spell\nWhen a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.  Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.\n\nCasting T ime\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\n\nBonus Action\nA spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\n\nReactions\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\n\nLonger Casting Times\nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\n\nRange\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like\nmagic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like\nfireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the\nshieldspell, affect only you.

If a spell\nrequires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\n\nMaterial (M)\nCasting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a\ncomponent pouch or a\nspellcasting focus (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.  If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.  A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\n\nDuration\nA spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\n\nInstantaneous\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n\nConcentration\nSome spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.  If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).  Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration.

Here's a concise breakdown:\n\n**Movement Cost**:  \n- To **mount** a creature, a character uses **half their speed** to approach it and then takes a **bonus action** to mount.  \n- Once mounted, the character’s speed is determined by the **mount’s speed**, but they can use their **movement** (or reactions) to maneuver within the mount’s space.  \n\n**Risks and Considerations**:  \n1. **Mount Vulnerability**: If the mount is hit by attacks or takes damage, the character may be **thrown off** or forced to dismount, depending on the mount’s size and the attack’s effect (e.g., *Disengage* or *Reposition*).  \n2. **Forced Dismount**: If the mount is **incapacitated, killed, or falls**, the character must **dismount**. This requires a **reaction** and a **Dexterity saving throw** (DC 10 + the mount’s Constitution modifier) to avoid falling damage or being thrown.  \n3. **Combat Restrictions**: While mounted, the character cannot move unless the mount moves.

{"user_input": "I’m looking for a detailed description of acid damage in D&D 5e, including its flavor, typical sources such as the corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding, how it interacts with resistance and vulnerability, and any creative ways a GM might use acid damage to enhance storytelling in a campaign setting. Could you provide a comprehensive overview that covers both mechanical and narrative aspects?", "reference_contexts": ["Damage Types Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types. The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect. Acid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage. Bludgeoning. Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage. Cold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage. Fire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage. Force. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon. Lightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage. Necrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul. Piercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage. Poison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage. Psychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage. Radiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power. Slashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage. Thunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage. Damage Resistance and Vulnerability Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. If a creature or an object has resistanceto a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerabilityto a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it. Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage. Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters."], "response": "Acid damage in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition is a versatile and thematically rich damage type, often associated with corrosive, dissolving, or eroding effects. Here's a comprehensive overview of acid damage, blending its mechanical mechanics with narrative and storytelling potential:\n\n---\n\n### **Mechanical Aspects of Acid Damage**\n1. **Flavor and Effects**:  \n   Acid damage is characterized by its ability to **dissolve, erode, or corrode**—both physical and magical. It is often described as a **painful, burning, and slow-acting** effect, with lingering consequences. For example, a creature hit by acid might describe the sensation as \"the flesh melting from their bones\" or \"a slow, agonizing dissolution.\"  \n   - **Physical Effects**: Acid can destroy materials (e.g., stone, metal, wood), weaken armor, or even corrode magical items.  \n   - **Biological Effects**: On living targets, acid causes **tissue decay, slow death, or dismemberment**, depending on the severity of the damage.  \n\n2. **Typical Sources**:  \n   - **Black Dragon Breath (Draconic Magic)**: A black dragon’s breath weapon deals 10d6 acid damage, reflecting its **corrosive, searing** nature. The description often emphasizes the **suffocating, acidic mist** that corrodes armor and flesh.  \n   - **Black Pudding (Monstrous Biology)**: A black pudding’s pseudopods secrete **dissolving enzymes** that reduce living and nonliving matter to pulp. This is a key mechanic for the creature, as it can **dissolve entire creatures or structures**.  \n   - **Alchemical Items**: Items like *acid vials* or *alchemist’s fire* deal 1d6 acid damage, often used by artificers or alchemists.  \n   - **Environmental Hazards**: Natural environments (e.g., a sulfuric lake or a cave with acidic water) can inflict acid damage on creatures that enter.  \n\n3. **Resistance and Vulnerability**:  \n   - **Resistance**: Creatures with resistance to acid (e.g., *golem* or *construct* types) take **half damage** from acid attacks. This can be narrated as **thick, uncorroded armor** or **magical wards** that repel the damage.  \n   - **Vulnerability**: Creatures vulnerable to acid (e.g., *slimes*, *oozes*, or *constructs* with specific weaknesses) take **double damage**. This might be described as **cracking armor**, **dissolving flesh**, or **corrosive reactions** that accelerate destruction.  \n   - **Interaction**: If a creature is immune to acid, it takes **no damage** (e.g., *constructs* with *construct immunity* or *undead* with *undead immunity*).  \n\n---\n\n### **Creative Storytelling Uses for Acid Damage**\n1. **Environmental Storytelling**:  \n   - **Haunted or cursed locations**: A dungeon with **acidic pools** or **corrosive mist** can create tension, forcing players to navigate carefully or risk being weakened.  \n   - **Natural hazards**: A **volcanic region** or **underground lake** could be laced with acid, adding environmental challenges (e.g., \"The ground is unstable—step too hard, and you’ll sink into a pit of burning acid\").  \n\n2. **Monster Design and Flavor**:  \n   - **Black Pudding**: Its ability to **dissolve entire parties** can create dramatic moments, especially if the party is caught unaware. The narrative could emphasize the **slow, inevitable destruction** of the pudding’s touch.  \n   - **Constructs**: Acid damage can be used to **weaken or destroy constructs**, reflecting their vulnerability to corrosive agents (e.g., \"The golem’s metal joints begin to corrode as the acid eats through its armor\").  \n\n3. **Role-Playing and Quest Mechanics**:  \n   - **Cursed Items**: A cursed artifact might deal acid damage when used, forcing the party to **avoid using it** or find a way to **neutralize the curse** (e.g., \"This dagger is cursed—it burns your skin with every strike\").  \n   - **Character Vulnerability**: A character might be **vulnerable to acid** due to a curse or mutation, creating a narrative hook (e.g., \"The druid’s transformation has left her flesh brittle—acid attacks could kill her in seconds\").  \n\n4. **Puzzle and Challenge Design**:  \n   - **Traps**: Acid traps (e.g., *Acid Spray* or *Dissolving Floor*) can force players to solve puzzles (e.g., \"The floor is dissolving—find a way to bypass it or find a shield\").  \n   - **Magic Items**: A **ring of acid resistance** or **scroll of acid vulnerability** could be used to alter encounters, creating opportunities for role-playing or strategic choices.  \n\n5. **Thematic Synergy**:  \n   - **Corruption and Decay**: Acid damage can symbolize **corruption, decay, or the slow destruction of life**. This ties into themes of entropy, decay, or the consequences of hubris.  \n   - **Contrast with Fire**: While fire is often described as **instantaneous and explosive**, acid is **gradual and insidious**, creating a contrast in storytelling (e.g., \"The fire is quick, but the acid will destroy you slowly—choose your fight wisely\").  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nAcid damage is a powerful tool for both **mechanical balance** and **narrative depth**. Its ability to **dissolve, weaken, and destroy** makes it ideal for encounters involving monsters like black dragons or black puddings, environmental challenges, and thematic storytelling. By leveraging resistance, vulnerability, and creative uses, a GM can craft encounters that are both **challenging and thematically rich**, enhancing the overall experience of the campaign.", "reference": "Acid damage is one of the many damage types in D&D 5e.

{"user_input": "What is a death saving throw?", "reference_contexts": ["Healing Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a cure woundsspell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant. When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8. A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the revivifyspell has restored it to life. Dropping to 0 Hit Points When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections. Instant Death Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies. Falling Unconscious If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix PH-A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points. Death Saving Throws Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw. Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable. Rolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point. Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death."], "response": "A death saving throw is a Constitution saving throw that a character makes when they are at 0 hit points and are dying. Each turn, the character must roll a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 10. Success on the save stabilizes the character, and they stop taking damage from subsequent hits. Failure means the character takes a level of exhaustion. If a character fails three death saving throws, they die. Alternatively, if they succeed on three death saving throws, they stabilize and remain alive. Characters can also be stabilized by others, such as through healing spells or potions, which prevents them from failing death saves.", "reference": "When you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a death saving throw.

{"user_input": "What does a Bard give you when you multiclass?", "reference_contexts": ["Multiclassing Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character. As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility. Prerequisites To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores. Multiclassing Prerequisites Class Ability Score Minimum Barbarian Strength 13 Bard Charisma 13 Cleric Wisdom 13 Druid Wisdom 13 Fighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 Monk Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Paladin Strength 13 and Charisma 13 Ranger Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Rogue Dexterity 13 Sorcerer Charisma 13 Warlock Charisma 13 Wizard Intelligence 13 Experience Points The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric. Hit Points and Hit Dice You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice. Proficiency Bonus Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3. Proficiencies When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table. Multiclassing Proficiencies Class Proficiencies Gained Barbarian Shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Bard Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice Cleric Light armor, medium armor, shields Druid Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal) Fighter Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Monk Sim ple weapons, shortswords Paladin Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Ranger Light armor, medium armor, shields, s im ple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list Rogue Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’ tools Sorcerer - Warlock Light armor, sim ple weapons Wizard - Class Features When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting. Channel Divinity If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes. Extra Attack If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack. Unarmored Defense If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class. Spellcasting Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class. Spells Known and Prepared.

Here's a breakdown of what you receive:\n\n### 1. **Spellcasting Flexibility (Charisma)**\n   - Bards use **Charisma** as their spellcasting ability, which means you can focus on improving your Charisma score to boost your spellcasting.\n   - Bards have access to a wide range of spells, including **enchantments, illusions, and divinations**, which are useful for support, utility, and role-playing.\n   - You can cast **spells from the Bard spell list** as a spellcaster, and you can prepare and cast spells in a way that complements your other classes (e.g., using spells to enhance your martial abilities or aid allies).\n\n### 2. **Bardic Inspiration (1/day)**\n   - Starting at 2nd level, you gain **inspiration** (a d6) that you can use to grant your allies a **+1 bonus** to an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. This ability is limited by your level (you gain one use of inspiration per level, up to a maximum of 5).\n   - This is a powerful tool for **supporting allies** in combat or during skill checks, making Bard a great multiclass choice for characters who want to enhance their party's performance.\n\n### 3. **Ritual Casting**\n   - Bards can cast **rituals** without expending a spell slot, which is useful for non-combat magic (e.g., identifying magical items, creating wards, or solving puzzles).\n\n### 4. **Performance and Roleplay Features**\n   - Bards have features that allow them to **perform** and **influence others**, such as the **Inspiration** ability (which can be used to grant allies inspiration) and the **Jack of All Trades** feature (proficiency in a wide range of skills).\n   - These features make Bard an excellent choice for characters who want to **roleplay effectively** or use diplomacy, performance, or storytelling to achieve goals.\n\n### 5. **Multiclass Synergy**\n   - When multiclassing, you can combine Bard with classes like **Fighter, Rogue, or Cleric** to create hybrid characters with unique abilities. For example:\n     - **Fighter/Bard**: Use Bardic Inspiration to enhance your martial abilities and gain access to spells that support your combat style.\n     - **Rogue/Bard**: Use spells and inspiration to boost your sneak attack damage and enhance your rogue's abilities.\n     - **Cleric/Bard**: Use spells for healing and support, while using inspiration to aid your allies.\n\n### Summary:\nMulticlassing into Bard gives you **versatile spellcasting**, the ability to **inspire and support allies**, and **roleplay tools** that make you a valuable asset to your party.

{"user_input": "What happens to a character's hit point maximum when they level up beyond 1st level?", "reference_contexts": ["Beyond 1st Level As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level. When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels. Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up). When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.

If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook. Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus. Spell Slots. You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table. If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher level. For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells.

{"user_input": "how many spell slots paladin get if multiclass with ranger?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nAlignment A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations. These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment. Lawful good(LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good. Neutral good(NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good. Chaotic good(CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good. Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral. Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral. Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral. Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil. Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil. Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil. Alignment in the Multiverse For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery. The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.) Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil. Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments-they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature.

If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook. Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus. Spell Slots. You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table. If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare.

{"user_input": "how ranger 4 wizard 3 get spell slot and what spells they know and prepare?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nMulticlassing Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character. As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility. Prerequisites To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores. Multiclassing Prerequisites Class Ability Score Minimum Barbarian Strength 13 Bard Charisma 13 Cleric Wisdom 13 Druid Wisdom 13 Fighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 Monk Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Paladin Strength 13 and Charisma 13 Ranger Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Rogue Dexterity 13 Sorcerer Charisma 13 Warlock Charisma 13 Wizard Intelligence 13 Experience Points The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric. Hit Points and Hit Dice You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice. Proficiency Bonus Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3. Proficiencies When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table. Multiclassing Proficiencies Class Proficiencies Gained Barbarian Shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Bard Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice Cleric Light armor, medium armor, shields Druid Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal) Fighter Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Monk Sim ple weapons, shortswords Paladin Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Ranger Light armor, medium armor, shields, s im ple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list Rogue Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’ tools Sorcerer - Warlock Light armor, sim ple weapons Wizard - Class Features When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting. Channel Divinity If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes. Extra Attack If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack. Unarmored Defense If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class. Spellcasting Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class. Spells Known and Prepared.

Multiclassing Prerequisites Class Ability Score Minimum Barbarian Strength 13 Bard Charisma 13 Cleric Wisdom 13 Druid Wisdom 13 Fighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 Monk Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Paladin Strength 13 and Charisma 13 Ranger Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Rogue Dexterity 13 Sorcerer Charisma 13 Warlock Charisma 13 Wizard Intelligence 13 Experience Points The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric. Hit Points and Hit Dice You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice. Proficiency Bonus Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3. Proficiencies When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table. Multiclassing Proficiencies Class Proficiencies Gained Barbarian Shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Bard Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice Cleric Light armor, medium armor, shields Druid Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal) Fighter Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Monk Sim ple weapons, shortswords Paladin Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Ranger Light armor, medium armor, shields, s im ple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list Rogue Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’ tools Sorcerer - Warlock Light armor, sim ple weapons Wizard - Class Features When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting. Channel Divinity If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes. Extra Attack If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack. Unarmored Defense If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class. Spellcasting Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class. Spells Known and Prepared. You determine what spells you know and"], "response": "Monks in Dungeons & Dragons are typically classified within the alignment system as **Lawful Neutral** or **Lawful Good**, reflecting their disciplined, self-controlled, and often morally upright nature. Their training emphasizes order, self-restraint, and the pursuit of martial and spiritual excellence. While not strictly bound to a singular moral code (as some monk traditions may prioritize personal virtue or the protection of the weak), the alignment of a monk is often shaped by their adherence to the rules of their order and the ethical principles they follow. This alignment classification influences their interactions with other characters, their approach to conflict, and the types of quests or moral dilemmas they might face.\n\nRegarding ability score prerequisites for multiclassing into or out of the monk class, the **second context segment** specifies the following requirements:  \n1. **Wisdom and Dexterity**: A monk must have a **minimum Wisdom score of 13** and a **minimum Dexterity score of 13** to qualify for multiclassing into the monk class. These scores are critical because they support the monk’s core mechanics, such as using Wisdom for spellcasting (if a spellcasting monk) and Dexterity for Unarmored Defense and mobility.  \n2. **Ability Score Balance**: A monk’s **Wisdom and Dexterity scores must be at least equal to the other ability scores** (e.g., Strength, Constitution, Intelligence, Charisma). This ensures the character is not overly reliant on a single stat, maintaining the monk’s versatility in combat and skill checks.  \n\nThese prerequisites influence a monk’s character progression and level advancement in several ways:  \n- **Multiclassing into the monk class**: Meeting the ability score requirements ensures the character can effectively utilize the monk’s features, such as Flurry of Blows, Martial Arts, and Unarmored Defense. If a character fails to meet these stats, they may struggle with the class’s mechanics, leading to suboptimal performance.  \n- **Multiclassing out of the monk class**: If a monk later gains a new class, their ability scores may still need to support the monk’s existing features (e.g., maintaining a high Dexterity score to retain Unarmored Defense). However, the monk’s progression is not strictly tied to these stats once the character has advanced in level, as ability scores can be improved through leveling up or magic items.  \n- **Character Balance**: The prerequisites encourage a balanced build, preventing over-reliance on a single stat and ensuring the monk remains a versatile, well-rounded character across different scenarios.  \n\nIn summary, the alignment classification and ability score prerequisites for monks are designed to reinforce the class’s role as a disciplined, agile, and ethically grounded martial artist, while ensuring their progression aligns with the game’s mechanics and balance.", "reference": "In the alignment description, monks are listed among the lawful neutral creatures, meaning they act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. When a character wants to multiclass into the monk class, the prerequisites table in the multiclassing section states that the character must have a Dexterity score of at least 13 and a Wisdom score of at least 13. These scores must be met in addition to any ability score prerequisites of the character’s current class. Because multiclassing levels are added together to determine overall character level, a monk who gains levels in another class will still be considered a monk for alignment purposes, but the character’s total level will increase, affecting experience point requirements, hit dice, proficiency bonus, and other class features. Thus, the alignment classification remains lawful neutral, while the ability score prerequisites ensure that the character has the necessary Dexterity and Wisdom to benefit from the monk’s unarmored defense and other monk features, influencing how the character progresses across multiple classes.", "answer_relevancy": 0.7790472952644235, "semantic_similarity": 0.5609183577427113, "bleu_score": 0.03269850229517512, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.2134646962233169, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.14772727272727273, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.38461538461538464}

Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign. Cackle Fever This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.” Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease is cured. Any event that causes the infected creature great stress-including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare-forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success. Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours. At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later. Sewer Plague Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs. When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected. It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest. At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease. Sight Rot This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim. A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal. Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely."], "response": "Integrating **Sight Rot** into your campaign can create a haunting, immersive experience that ties into both the mechanics and lore of *Dungeons & Dragons*. Here’s how you can weave it in, flavor it, and use the **eyebright cure** creatively:\n\n---\n\n### **Flavor and Lore Integration**\n1. **Cursed Origins**: Tie Sight Rot to a cursed artifact, an ancient elven or fae curse, or a divine punishment. For example:\n   - *The Hollowing*: A forgotten elven city cursed by a druid who once betrayed his kin. The disease spreads through the remnants of their magic.\n   - *The Withering Gaze*: A god’s wrath on a village that defied a prophecy, causing the curse to manifest as Sight Rot.\n2. **Environmental Storytelling**: Use the disease’s effects (blinding, madness, hallucinations) to create atmospheric tension. Describe the corruption of the land—trees with hollow eyes, rivers that shimmer with \"vision-rot,\" or NPCs who speak in fragmented, distorted voices.\n3. **Moral Ambiguity**: The disease could force the party to make difficult choices. For example, curing a victim might require sacrificing another’s sight, or the cure could be tied to a moral test (e.g., facing a memory from the past).\n\n---\n\n### **Gameplay Mechanics for Immersion**\n1. **Spread the Disease**: Use the **Contagion** spell or a homebrew rule to spread Sight Rot to NPCs or enemies. For example:\n   - A cursed NPC (e.g., a blind merchant) infects the party with a whisper: *“You’ll see the world as I do…”*\n   - Enemies with *Blindness/Deafness* or *Misty Step* could be immune to the disease, adding a layer of strategy.\n2. **Madness as a Plot Device**: The **madness** effect (PHB, p. 263) can drive NPCs to self-destruct or become allies. For instance:\n   - A priest infected with Sight Rot sees gods as monsters, leading to a tragic arc.\n   - A monster’s “vision” (from the disease) could be a hallucination that reveals its true form (e.g., a goblin king who believes himself a god).\n3. **Environmental Challenges**: Use the disease’s effects in puzzles. For example:\n   - A door requires the party to *see* a hidden symbol, but those infected with Sight Rot instead see a vision of the past.\n   - A labyrinth only reveals its true path to those who have lost their sight (e.g., a blind character gains a *Truesight* ability temporarily).\n\n---\n\n### **Creative Use of Eyebright as a Cure**\n1. **The Quest for the Flower**:\n   - **Location**: The flower grows only in a cursed glade guarded by a **spectral guardian** (e.g., a druid’s spirit) or a **mysterious forest** where trees whisper secrets.\n   - **Challenges**: The party must solve riddles, avoid hallucinations, or defeat a **mad druid** who guards the flower. The flower could be *magically unstable*—using it might risk the party’s sanity.\n   - **Twist**: The flower is not a cure but a *key*. Using it requires a ritual involving the **disease’s source** (e.g., a cursed relic or a spirit).\n2. **Penalties for Using the Cure**:\n   - **Sacrifice**: Curing a character costs a *spell slot* or a *sacrifice* (e.g., the party must give up a memory or a loved one’s soul).\n   - **Corruption**: The flower’s magic corrupts the user. For example:\n     - The character gains *Truesight* but becomes permanently blind to the real world.\n     - The cure only works once; after that, the flower is destroyed, and the disease becomes permanent.\n3. **Moral Dilemmas**:\n   - **The Flower’s Price**: The flower is sacred to a deity (e.g., a god of the blind). Using it angers the deity, leading to divine intervention (e.g., a vision of the future, or a curse on the party).\n   - **The Last Flower**: The party discovers the flower is the last of its kind. Using it could destroy the ecosystem or awaken a slumbering evil.\n\n---\n\n### **Twist Ideas**\n1. **The Disease is a Blessing**: The madness effect might reveal hidden truths or visions of the future. A character infected could see a prophecy that changes the story’s direction.\n2. **The Cure is a Trap**: The eyebright flower is a *trap set by the disease’s creator*. Using it forces the party into a vision of their own worst fears.\n3. **The Disease is a Test**: The party is being tested by a god or archdevil. Surviving Sight Rot proves their worth, but failing means their souls are claimed.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Quest: “The Hollowed Eye”**\n- **Hook**: A village is being consumed by Sight Rot. The party is hired to find the cure, but the flower is guarded by a **blind oracle** who demands a test of sight (e.g., seeing the truth in a mirror of lies).\n- **Twist**: The flower is tied to the village’s past. Using it reveals that the disease was a curse placed by the villagers themselves to escape a greater threat.\n- **Resolution**: The party must choose between curing the village (and risking the curse’s return) or leaving the disease to teach a lesson.\n\n---\n\nBy blending the disease’s mechanics with moral choices, environmental storytelling, and creative twists, Sight Rot can become a central, haunting element of your campaign.", "reference": "Sight Rot is a painful infection that bleeds from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.

{"user_input": "what does greater restoration do to madness?", "reference_contexts": ["Madness In a typical campaign, characters aren’t driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face. Going Mad Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them. Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. Madness Effects Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness. A character afflicted with short-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes. A character afflicted with long-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours. A character afflicted with indefinite madnessgains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.

Long--Term Madness d100 Effect (lasts 1d10 × 10 hours) 01-10 The character feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting coins. 11-20 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks. 21-30 The character suffers extreme paranoia. Th e character has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks. 31-40 The character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell. 41-45 The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects. 46-55 The character becomes attached to a “lucky charm,” such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it. 56 - 65 The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%). 66-75 The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that in vo lve Strength or Dexterity. 76-85 The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn’t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took e ffect. 86 - 90 Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell.

{"user_input": "I read about Adamantine in the rules but i dont get it, can you explain how hard it is to hit an Adamantine object, what AC it has, and how it compares to other materials like iron or steel, and if it has any special properties like resistances or vulnerabilities?", "reference_contexts": ["Objects When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire’s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character’s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does. For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects. Statistics for Objects When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage. Armor Class. An object’s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances. Object Armor Class Substance AC Cloth, paper, rope 11 Crystal, glass, ice 13 Wood, bone 15 Stone 17 Iron, steel 19 Mithral 21 Adamantine 23 Hit Points. An object’s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller. Object Hit Points Size Fragile Resilient Tiny (bottle, lock) 2 (1d4) 5 (2d4) Small (chest, lute) 3 (1d6) 10 (3d6) Medium (barrel, chandelier) 4 (1d8) 18 (4d8) Large (cart, 10 --ft.--by--10--ft. window) 5 (1d10) 27 (5d10) Huge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquakespell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object’s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points. Objects and Damage Types.Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can’t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment. Damage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hit points."], "response": "**Adamantine** is an exceptionally rare and strong material in Dungeons & Dragons, known for its extraordinary durability and magical properties. Here’s a breakdown of its key characteristics:\n\n1. **Armor Class (AC):**  \n   Adamantine objects (like armor or shields) have an AC that reflects their high durability. For example, a *breastplate* made of Adamantine might have an AC of 20 or higher, depending on the specific item and its magical enhancements. This makes it extremely difficult to hit or damage with standard attacks.\n\n2. **Hardness and Damage Resistance:**  \n   - **Hardness:** Adamantine has a hardness of **20**, meaning it is nearly impossible to scratch or damage with normal weapons.  \n   - **Damage Resistance:** It has **resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage**. This means that even if an attack lands, only half the damage is applied (rounded down).\n\n3. **Comparison to Other Materials:**  \n   - **Iron:** Has a hardness of **5** and no inherent damage resistance.  \n   - **Steel:** Has a hardness of **10** and no inherent damage resistance.  \n   - **Adamantine** far surpasses both in terms of hardness and resistance, making it nearly unbreakable without magical or special weapons.\n\n4. **Special Properties:**  \n   - **Resistance to Damage Types:** As mentioned, Adamantine resists all non-magical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, slashing).  \n   - **Magical Use:** Often used in the construction of powerful magical items, such as *Adamantine Armor* (which grants +1 bonus to AC and resistance to non-magical damage) or *Adamantine weapons* (which ignore resistance and immunity to non-magical damage on a critical hit).  \n   - **Impossibly Durable:** Even a single hit from a mundane weapon or spell might do little to no damage, making Adamantine objects nearly indestructible in combat unless targeted by high-level magic or specialized tools.\n\nIn summary, **Adamantine is the pinnacle of material strength in the game**, offering unmatched durability, damage resistance, and magical utility compared to common materials like iron or steel.", "reference": "Adamantine objects have an Armor Class of 23.", "answer_relevancy": 0.6339225968938133, "semantic_similarity": 0.32560714149388836, "bleu_score": 0.017911710595643587, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.038834951456310676, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.019933554817275746, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.75}

Poisons come in the following four types. Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects. Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save. Inhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body. Injury. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

Here are the key details about how it works, its cost, who uses it, its effects, and the overall vibe it brings to your story:\n\n### **Mechanics and Rules:**\n- **Cost:** 100 gp per vial (or 100 gp per dose, as it is typically used in doses).\n- **Usage:** The fumes are inhaled, and they are a single-use item. One vial provides one dose.\n- **Effect:** When a creature inhales the fumes, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be **incapacitated** for 1 hour. The fumes are *not* magical, so magical resistance does not apply.\n- **Duration:** The effects last for 1 hour unless the creature is already incapacitated, in which case the effect ends immediately.\n- **Recovery:** A creature that has failed the saving throw and is incapacitated can recover by using the *Remove Disease* spell, or by spending 1 hour of rest in a place with fresh air.\n\n### **Who Uses It:**\n- **Alchemists, warlocks, and other spellcasters** who deal in alchemical or infernal substances may use it.\n- **Cultists and villains** who seek to incapacitate enemies or enemies of their god (often associated with deities like **Baalzebul** or **Zehir**) may use it.\n- **Assassins or spies** looking for a non-lethal but incapacitating method of subduing a target might use Burnt Othur Fumes.\n\n### **What Happens When Breathed In:**\n- The fumes are **toxic and smoky**, and their effects are immediate and incapacitating.\n- The target is **dazed and unable to move or speak**, which is great for non-lethal subduing or interrogation.\n- The fumes are not lethal, but they are **extremely unpleasant**, causing nausea, dizziness, and a burning sensation in the lungs.\n- The fumes have a **distinctive, acrid smell** and **dark, smoky appearance**, which are described in the *Xanathar’s Guide*.\n\n### **Flavor and Vibe:**\n- **Atmosphere:** Burnt Othur Fumes create a **tense, oppressive, and claustrophobic** atmosphere. The smoke and fumes are described as **thick, choking, and hot**, with a **burning, metallic taste**.\n- **Symbolism:** The fumes are often associated with **corruption, betrayal, or infernal influence**, and can be used in scenes involving **treachery, interrogation, or ritualistic subjugation**.\n- **Use in Stories:** This substance is great for **non-lethal confrontations**, **interrogation scenes**, or **dungeons with alchemical traps**.

You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic. Spellcasting Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. Wild Shape Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed. Beast Shapes Level Max. CR Limitations Example 2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf 4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile 8th 1 - Giant eagle You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: •Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment,personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, andCharisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’sbonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them. •When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice.

Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment,based on the creature’s shape and size. Yourequipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. Druid Circle At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Timeless Body Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Beast Spells Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components. Archdruid At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape. Circle of the Land The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites. Bonus Cantrip When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. Natural Recovery Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. Circle Spells Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Nature’s Sanctuary When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you.

Sacred Plants and Wood A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. Druids and the Gods Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix PH--B include many such deities).

Nature’s Ward When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. Nature’s Sanctuary When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you.

Sacred Plants and Wood A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. Druids and the Gods Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix PH--B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.", "<2-hop>\n\nWild Shape, Druid Circle 2 3 - - - - - - - - 3rd +2 - 2 4 2 - - - - - - - 4th +2 Wild Shape improvement, Ability Score Improvement 3 4 3 - - - - - - - 5th +3 - 3 4 3 2 - - - - - - 6th +3 Druid Circle feature 3 4 3 3 - - - - - - 7th +3 - 3 4 3 3 1 - - - - - 8th +3 Wild Shape improvement, Ability Score Improvement 3 4 3 3 2 - - - - - 9th +4 - 3 4 3 3 3 1 - - - - 10th +4 Druid Circle feature 4 4 3 3 3 2 - - - - 11th +4 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 - - - 13th +5 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 14th +5 Druid Circle feature 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 - - 15th +5 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 - 17th +6 - 4 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 Timeless Body, Beast Spells 4 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 Archdruid 4 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Druidic You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic. Spellcasting Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. Wild Shape Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed. Beast Shapes Level Max. CR Limitations Example 2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf 4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile 8th 1 - Giant eagle You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: •Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment,personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, andCharisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’sbonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them. •When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice.

The spellcasting section states that a druid can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for their druid spells (see the paragraph that reads, \"You can use a druidic focus (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells\").  This focus is not limited to metal; druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal, and the focus is typically made from natural materials such as oak, yew, alder, or other sacred woods.  The druidic focus also ties into the druidic language, which is the secret language of druids; it can be used to leave hidden messages that only those who know the language can decipher.

When a Druid uses Wild Shape, they retain their class, race, and other features, but they lose the ability to speak, and they cannot take reactions or actions that require hands. Their hit points are based on the beast form they take, and any damage they take while in beast form is dealt to their hit point total. If the damage reduces their hit points to 0, they revert to their normal form with any remaining hit points, and any excess damage is applied normally. They can also choose to end the transformation at any time.\n\nWhen a Druid is in beast form, they lose the use of all armor and weapons they were wearing or carrying, and any equipment they were wearing or carrying is merged with their new form. This means that they cannot use any of the items they were wearing or carrying in their normal form, and they cannot use any of the items they were carrying in their normal form to cast spells that require material components. This is a problem for spells that require material components, as they cannot be used in beast form. However, the Druid can choose to maintain the use of certain items, such as a ring or a pendant, if they are not wearing armor or carrying weapons.\n\nThe Druid's class features like Land's Stride, Nature's Ward, and Nature's Sanctuary interact with Wild Shape in a few ways. Land's Stride allows the Druid to move through difficult terrain without expending extra movement, which is helpful in beast form when the Druid is moving through dense forest or other natural terrain. Nature's Ward allows the Druid to resist certain types of damage, which is also helpful in beast form when the Druid is facing enemies that deal that type of damage. Nature's Sanctuary allows the Druid to create a magical barrier that prevents certain types of attacks, which is also helpful in beast form when the Druid is facing enemies that deal that type of damage.\n\nThe equipment choices made at character creation can influence the Druid's ability to cast spells while in beast form. For example, if the Druid chooses to wear armor that is not magical, they will not be able to use it in beast form, as all armor is merged with the beast form. However, if the Druid chooses to wear a magical item that is not armor, such as a ring or a pendant, they may be able to use it in beast form. This is because the rules for merging equipment with beast form are not clear on whether magical items are considered part of the beast form or not.\n\nIn terms of spellcasting, the Druid can use their spellcasting ability while in beast form, but they cannot use any of the items they were wearing or carrying in their normal form to cast spells that require material components. This means that if the Druid wants to cast a spell that requires a material component, they must be in their normal form. However, the Druid can use their Wild Shape ability to transform into a beast that has the ability to use material components, such as a creature that has a natural ability to produce a certain type of material component.", "reference": "According to the Wild Shape rules in the first context, when a Druid reverts to normal form they return to the hit points they had before transforming. If the revert is caused by dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to the normal form. For example, taking 10 damage in animal form with only 1 hit point left causes a revert and the Druid takes 9 damage in normal form; as long as that excess damage does not reduce the normal form to 0, the Druid is not knocked unconscious. The rules also state that while in beast form the Druid cannot cast spells that require hands or speech, but they can still perform somatic and verbal components of spells they have already cast, and they retain any class features that are physically possible in the new form. Equipment handling is governed by the choice to let it fall, merge, or be worn. Worn equipment functions normally, but the GM decides if it is practical for the beast. Equipment that cannot be worn must either fall or merge; merged equipment has no effect until the Druid leaves the beast form.\n\nAt 18th level, the Druid gains the Beast Spells feature, allowing them to cast many druid spells while in any shape. They can perform somatic and verbal components in beast form, but cannot provide material components. At 20th level, the Archdruid feature lets the Druid ignore verbal and somatic components of druid spells, and also ignore material components that lack a cost and are not consumed. This means that Circle of the Land spells that normally require verbal or somatic components can be cast in beast form without those components, and material components that are free or non‑consumable can also be ignored. However, if a spell requires a material component that has a cost or is consumed, the Druid would still need to provide it, unless the equipment that would normally supply it is merged and therefore unavailable.\n\nThe Druid’s class features such as Land’s Stride, Nature’s Ward, and Nature’s Sanctuary are retained while in beast form as long as the new form is physically capable of using them. For example, Land’s Stride allows the Druid to move through non‑magical difficult terrain without extra cost, and Nature’s Ward provides immunity to poison and disease, both of which remain active in beast form. The equipment choices made at character creation—such as a wooden shield, a simple weapon, leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus—are subject to the same merge/fall/wear rules, so a druidic focus that is merged into the beast form cannot be used to provide a material component until the Druid leaves the form.\n\nIn summary, Wild Shape affects hit point recovery by restoring the pre‑transform hit points and carrying over excess damage, limits spellcasting to somatic and verbal components unless the Druid is an Archdruid, and requires careful consideration of equipment handling to determine whether material components can be supplied while in beast form. The Circle of the Land spells are fully usable in beast form under these rules, with component requirements waived at 20th level, but the availability of material components still depends on whether the necessary equipment is worn or merged.", "answer_relevancy": 0.7295538986793387, "semantic_similarity": 0.8994055449894889, "bleu_score": 0.08841390691276838, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.2579505300353357, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.25215889464594127, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.2640144665461121}

You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic. Spellcasting Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. Wild Shape Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed. Beast Shapes Level Max. CR Limitations Example 2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf 4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile 8th 1 - Giant eagle You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: •Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment,personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, andCharisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’sbonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them. •When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When"], "response": "The use of **Druidic** (a secret language known by all druids) and its interaction with **Wild Shape** and **spellcasting** are nuanced and governed by specific rules in the *Player’s Handbook*. Here’s a structured breakdown of how these elements interact:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Druidic and Wild Shape (Including 18th-Level Abilities)**\n- **Druidic Language in Beast Form**: When a druid uses *Wild Shape* to assume a beast form, they lose the ability to **speak** any languages, including **Druidic**. However, they retain the ability to **understand** all languages they know, including Druidic. This means they can *comprehend* written Druidic messages (e.g., hidden notes, inscriptions) but cannot *speak* or *write* in the language while in beast form.\n- **18th-Level Wild Shape**: At 18th level, a druid can assume a beast form with a challenge rating up to 20. This doesn’t alter the rules for Druidic; the above applies regardless of the beast’s power level.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Spellcasting and Equipment in Beast Form**\n- **Spellcasting**: While in beast form, a druid cannot cast spells. Thus, **Druidic** does not directly influence spellcasting mechanics in this state. Any spells that require verbal components (e.g., *Druidic* as a focus) are irrelevant here.\n- **Equipment (Focus Items)**: A druid’s spellcasting focus (e.g., a staff, crystal, or natural component) is not affected by Wild Shape. However, while in beast form, the druid cannot use their focus to cast spells (since spellcasting is disabled). The focus remains with them but is unused in this state.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Detecting Hidden Messages in Druidic**\n- **Understanding Druidic**: A druid can read and understand any written message in Druidic, even if they are in beast form. For example, if a scroll or inscription is written in Druidic, the druid *comprehends* it, even if they cannot speak or write it (as they would in beast form). This ability does not depend on verbal communication but on the druid’s innate knowledge of the language.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Druidic Focus and Spellcasting in Beast Form**\n- **Druidic Focus**: The *Druidic* focus (a staff, crystal, or similar item) is used to cast spells. However, while in beast form, the druid cannot cast spells, so the focus is **not used** in this state. The focus’s role in spellcasting is entirely disconnected from the ability to speak or understand Druidic.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- **Druidic** is understood in beast form but cannot be spoken, affecting communication but not spellcasting or equipment use.\n- **Hidden messages** in Druidic are detectable by the druid, even in beast form.\n- **Spellcasting** and **equipment** (including focus items) are unaffected by Druidic in beast form, as the druid cannot cast spells while in this state.", "reference": "At 18th level a druid gains the Beast Spells feature, which lets them cast many druid spells while in any Wild Shape. The rules state that while in beast form the druid can perform the somatic and verbal components of a spell, but cannot provide material components. This means that a druid can still speak Druidic (the secret language) while in beast form, because speaking is a verbal action. The Druidic language rules say that anyone who knows Druidic automatically spots a hidden message written in it, and others can detect its presence with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but cannot decipher it without magic. Thus, a druid can leave a hidden Druidic message in beast form, and other druids will spot it instantly, while non‑druids will only notice the presence.\n\nEquipment rules for Wild Shape say that a druid may choose whether equipment falls, merges, or is worn. Equipment that merges has no effect until the druid leaves the form. Because the druid’s equipment does not change size or shape to match the beast, any gear that the beast cannot wear must either fall or merge. Therefore, while in beast form a druid cannot use a weapon or armor that the beast cannot physically hold or wear, even though the druid retains the ability to cast spells.\n\nThe ability to speak Druidic is not limited by the beast form; the rules explicitly allow verbal components in beast form. However, the druid cannot provide material components unless the beast form can hold them. The Archdruid feature at 20th level removes the need for verbal and somatic components entirely, so a 20th‑level druid could cast a spell in beast form without speaking Druidic at all.\n\nIn summary: a druid can speak Druidic while Wild‑shaped, can leave hidden messages that other druids spot instantly, can cast spells that require verbal components (but not material components unless the beast can hold them), and equipment that merges with the beast form is inert until the druid reverts.", "answer_relevancy": 0.7369847262464576, "semantic_similarity": 0.3908756362379986, "bleu_score": 0.031192646172235442, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.2199223803363519, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.19540229885057472, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.2514792899408284}
{"user_input": "Which skill proficiency does the Acolyte background provide that allows a character to read people's motives and intentions?", "reference_contexts": ["Equipment Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background. Suggested Characteristics A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation. Customizing a Background You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one. Acolyte You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power. Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Shelter of the Faithful As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple. Suggested Characteristics Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme. d8 Personality Trait 1 I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example. 2 I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. 3 I see omens in every event and action.

Equipment Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer’s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s rest in a poor inn. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot. Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell. Magic Items.Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such. Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first. Trade Goods.On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods-bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on-retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency. Armor Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield. The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds. Armor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells. Armor Class (AC).Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class. Heavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score. Stealth. If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Shields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time. Light Armor Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class. Padded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting. Leather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer"], "response": "The GM has significant flexibility in handling exceptionally valuable treasures, as the rules do not mandate a single approach. Here are key considerations and common practices:\n\n1. **Adjustment for Balance**: If a treasure is overly powerful or unbalanced, the GM may modify its distribution (e.g., splitting it among the party, reducing its rarity, or adjusting its effects to better fit the campaign's tone and the party's level).\n\n2. **Use as a Plot Device**: The GM might tie the treasure to the story, such as making it a key to a future quest or a source of conflict (e.g., a cursed item that requires a quest to purify).\n\n3. **Reward Creativity**: Exceptionally valuable treasures can reward clever roleplay, problem-solving, or teamwork, ensuring that rewards are meaningful and tied to the party's actions.\n\n4. **Campaign Tone**: The GM should consider the setting's tone. In a high-magic or high-fantasy campaign, powerful items may be appropriate, while in a low-magic or gritty setting, the GM might scale back the treasure's impact.\n\n5. **Party Needs**: If the party is struggling, the GM might distribute the treasure more liberally to help them progress. Conversely, if the party is doing well, the GM might reserve the treasure for future encounters.\n\nUltimately, the GM's goal is to maintain balance, enhance the story, and ensure the treasure feels rewarding and integrated into the world.", "reference": "For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.", "answer_relevancy": 0.8796328177691075, "semantic_similarity": 0.6455118570629448, "bleu_score": 0.12268455197800027, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.09302325581395349, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.05063291139240506, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.5714285714285714}

Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes. Medium Armor Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class. Hide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor. Chain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers. Scale Mail.This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets. Breastplate.This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered. Half Plate.Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps. Heavy Armor Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative. Ring Mail.This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor. Chain Mail.Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets. Splint.This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints. Plate.Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring. The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance. Weapon Proficiency Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

Here's a structured breakdown of its role and usage:\n\n### **Lore & Historical Context**\n- **Types of Medium Armor**: Common examples include *Chain Mail*, *Scale Mail*, and *Half-Plate*. Each has distinct origins: chain mail, for instance, evolved from ancient Roman lorica hamata, while scale mail was used by various cultures, including Vikings and ancient Greeks.\n- **Cultural Significance**: Medium Armor often symbolizes the transition from a novice to an experienced warrior. It was used by mercenaries, soldiers, and knights who required protection but still needed agility. In some settings, it might be associated with specific factions or classes, such as paladins or rangers who prioritize mobility over maximum defense.\n\n### **Gameplay Mechanics**\n- **Armor Class (AC)**: Medium Armor typically provides an AC of 15–18, depending on the type and magical enhancements. This is higher than Light Armor (AC 11–14) but lower than Heavy Armor (AC 18–19).\n- **Movement Penalty**: Wearing Medium Armor usually imposes a -2 speed penalty, making it ideal for characters who need to balance defense with mobility (e.g., rogues, paladins, or fighters in dynamic combat scenarios).\n\n### **Narrative Integration**\n1. **Character Development**: Medium Armor can mark a character's growth. For example, a young warrior might start with Light Armor and upgrade to Medium as they gain experience. Alternatively, a character might be cursed or forced to wear Medium Armor, adding depth to their story.\n2. **Setting & Culture**: Use Medium Armor to reflect a setting’s technological or cultural state. In a medieval fantasy world, it might be the standard for soldiers, while in a high-magic setting, it could be rare or enchanted.\n3. **Plot Devices**: Armor can drive subplots. A quest to recover a lost piece of Medium Armor (e.g., a relic of a fallen knight) or a curse tied to a specific suit of armor can add narrative tension.\n4. **Flavor & Personality**: A character’s choice of armor can reflect their personality. A rogue might prefer *Chain Mail* for its flexibility, while a paladin could wear *Half-Plate* to emphasize their role as a protector.\n\n### **Examples in Storytelling**\n- **The Rogue’s Dilemma**: A rogue upgrades from Light Armor to *Chain Mail* after surviving a dangerous encounter, showing their increased confidence and need for protection.\n- **The Knight’s Burden**: A paladin is forced to wear *Scale Mail* after a curse, which slows them but grants a unique ability (e.g., resistance to fire). This adds a layer of challenge and character depth.\n- **Cultural Symbolism**: In a campaign set in a Viking-inspired realm, *Scale Mail* could be a family heirloom, with its use tied to a character’s lineage or a quest to restore honor.\n\n### **Flavor Text & Lore Integration**\n- **Historical Flair**: Armor descriptions in the *Player’s Handbook* often hint at their origins. For example, *Chain Mail* might have a flavor text about its use in ancient battles, while *Half-Plate* could reference noble houses or knights.\n- **Magic & Artifacts**: Enchanted Medium Armor can be tied to lore, such as a relic that once belonged to a legendary hero or a cursed artifact that grants powers at a cost.\n\nMedium Armor is versatile, allowing for both practical gameplay and rich storytelling. Its use can reflect a character’s growth, a setting’s cultural context, and the balance between defense and mobility in the game’s mechanics.", "reference": "Medium Armor offers more protection than light armor but impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, up to +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

{"user_input": "what damage improvised weapon does if no resemblance to weapon and what range improvised thrown weapon?", "reference_contexts": ["from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way. Finesse.When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Heavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively. Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Loading. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range. Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. Special. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section). Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack. Improvised Weapons Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Silvered Weapons Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective. Special Weapons Weapons with special rules are described here. Lance.You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted. Net.A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Acid. As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage. Alchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. Antitoxin.A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs. Arcane Focus.An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item-designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus. Ball Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift. Book. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section). Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Case, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts. Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment. Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor. Component Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description). Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied. Druidic Focus.A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus. Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield. Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot. Hunting Trap.

Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature. Lamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius. Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices. Magnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed. Manacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points. Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl. Oil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. Poison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. Potion of Healing. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action. Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check. Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts. Rope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check. Scale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth. Spellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells. Spyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two. Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute. Torch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of its key details:\n\n### 1. **What It Is**\n   - The **Arcane Focus** is a **spell component** (specifically, a *focus*), not a magical item with inherent powers. It replaces the need for material components when casting spells that require them. This is especially useful for spellcasters like wizards, who often need to cast spells quickly or with their hands free.\n\n### 2. **Cost**\n   - The Arcane Focus costs **10 gp** in the *Player’s Handbook*. This makes it an affordable and practical item for spellcasters who need a reliable focus for their spells.\n\n### 3. **Weight**\n   - The Arcane Focus is **lightweight**, typically weighing **1 pound** or less (exact weight not specified in official rules). This makes it easy to carry, even for characters with limited carrying capacity.\n\n### 4. **Special Properties**\n   - **Replaces Material Components**: When a spell requires a material component, the Arcane Focus can be used instead. This eliminates the need to carry additional components or worry about losing them in combat.\n   - **No Magical Abilities**: Unlike other magical items, the Arcane Focus has no inherent magic or special abilities. Its sole purpose is to serve as a focus for spellcasting.\n\n### 5. **Usage**\n   - The Arcane Focus is **not consumed** during spellcasting. It can be used repeatedly for any spell that requires a material component.\n   - It is **not a one-time-use item** and does not degrade or break when used.\n\n### Summary\nThe Arcane Focus is a **10 gp, lightweight, non-magical tool** that allows spellcasters to cast spells without using material components. It is a **focus** (a type of spell component) and is essential for wizards and other spellcasters who need a reliable, hands-free way to channel their magic.", "reference": "Arcane focus Crystal is listed as an item that costs 10 gp.", "answer_relevancy": 0.5796853916180155, "semantic_similarity": 0.6265085739451649, "bleu_score": 0.01121617874316939, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.048338368580060416, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.025078369905956112, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.6666666666666666}

The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature. Lamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius. Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices. Magnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed. Manacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points. Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl. Oil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. Poison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. Potion of Healing. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action. Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check. Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts. Rope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check. Scale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth. Spellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells. Spyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two. Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute. Torch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

Here's how this works:\n\n1. **Escape the Trap**: The character must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the trap's damage and free themselves from the chain's restriction. Once they succeed, they are no longer affected by the trap's movement limitation.\n\n2. **Use the Potion of Healing**: After escaping, the character can use their action to consume the potion. The potion requires the character to be able to speak, but since the trap only limits movement and does not prevent speech, this condition is met.\n\n3. **Effect of the Potion**: Upon drinking the potion, the character regains **2d8 + 2 hit points** immediately. This is a straightforward recovery with no additional restrictions, assuming the character is still alive and able to speak.\n\n**Key Considerations**:  \n- The trap's restriction (movement limitation) does not prevent the character from using the potion, as the potion only requires the ability to speak.  \n- The character must have the potion in their inventory and be able to take an action to use it after escaping the trap.  \n- If the character is incapacitated (e.g., unconscious), they cannot speak and thus cannot use the potion.

As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage. Alchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. Antitoxin.A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs. Arcane Focus.An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item-designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus. Ball Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift. Book. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section). Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Case, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts. Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment. Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor. Component Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description). Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied. Druidic Focus.A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus. Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield. Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot. Hunting Trap.

Here's a concise breakdown of your questions with rule citations and subtle lore nuances:\n\n---\n\n### **Strength Requirement and Consequences of Dropping Below 13**\n- **Requirement**: To take the Grappler feat, your Strength must be **13 or higher** at the time of selection. This is a **prerequisite** (PHB, p. 165).  \n- **If Strength drops below 13**:  \n  - You **lose the benefit** of the feat. The rules do not allow retraining feats if you no longer meet their prerequisites (PHB, p. 165).  \n  - This mirrors the lore: grappling is a physically demanding skill, and a weakening character would logically become less effective in combat.  \n\n---\n\n### **Taking the Feat Instead of an Ability Score Improvement**\n- **At 4th level and every even level** (PHB, p. 165), you can choose to take a **feat instead of an Ability Score Improvement**.  \n- **Important**: Once you take the Grappler feat in place of an Improvement, you **cannot switch back** to the Improvement later. This is a permanent trade-off.  \n\n---\n\n### **Losing the Prerequisite Later**\n- If your Strength later drops below 13, the feat’s benefits are **lost permanently**. There is no rule for \"retraining\" feats to meet prerequisites (PHB, p. 165).  \n- This reinforces the idea that the Grappler feat is tied to your character’s physical prowess, and a weakening character would no longer qualify.  \n\n---\n\n### **Lore Nuance**\nThe Grappler feat’s emphasis on Strength reflects a character’s reliance on raw physicality in combat. In older D&D lore, grappling was often associated with barbarians or martial specialists, where strength was paramount. Losing the prerequisite would render the character’s training obsolete, aligning with the game’s thematic consistency.  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- **Strength Requirement**: 13 (prerequisite).  \n- **If Strength drops below 13**: Lose the feat’s benefit permanently.  \n- **Feats vs. Ability Score Improvements**: A one-time choice with no undoing.  \n- **Lore**: Feats like Grappler are tightly bound to character growth, ensuring thematic and mechanical coherence.", "reference": "According to the rules, the Grappler feat requires Strength 13 or higher (Grappler Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher).

{"user_input": "tell me how advantage works in d20 rolls and how i can use it in my story i want to know how advantage changes the roll what happens if i have both advantage and disadvantage how halfling lucky trait interacts and how gm can give advantage i want long explanation", "reference_contexts": ["Using Ability Scores Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics: • Strength, measuring physical power • Dexterity, measuring agility • Constitution, measuring endurance • Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory • Wisdom, measuring perception and insight • Charisma, measuring force of personalityIs a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number. Ability Scores and Modifiers Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability. A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30. Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30. Ability Scores and Modifiers Score Modifier 1 −5 2-3 −4 4-5 −3 6-7 −2 8-9 −1 10-11 +0 12 - 13 +1 14 - 15 +2 16 - 17 +3 18 - 19 +4 20 - 21 +5 22 - 23 +6 24 - 25 +7 26 - 27 +8 28 - 29 +9 30 +10 To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down). Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores. Advantage and Disadvantage Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20. If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage. When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1. You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result."], "response": "quote\n</think>\n\nIn Dungeons & Dragons, advantage and disadvantage are mechanics that can significantly affect the outcome of a d20 roll. Here's how they work and how they can be used in your story:\n\n**Advantage on a d20 Roll:**\nWhen a character has advantage on a d20 roll, they roll two d20s and take the higher of the two results. This increases the chances of getting a high result, as the character has two chances to succeed rather than just one. Advantage can be granted by the GM for various reasons, such as when a character is in a favorable position, has help from an ally, or is using a special ability that grants advantage.\n\n**Disadvantage on a d20 Roll:**\nConversely, when a character has disadvantage on a d20 roll, they roll two d20s and take the lower of the two results. This decreases the chances of getting a high result, as the character is at a disadvantage. Disadvantage can be imposed by the GM for various reasons, such as when a character is in an unfavorable position, is hindered by an enemy, or is using a special ability that grants disadvantage.\n\n**Using Advantage and Disadvantage in Your Story:**\nAs a GM, you can use advantage and disadvantage to create tension and drama in your story. For example, you might give a character advantage when they are in a favorable position, such as when they are using a special ability or when they have the support of an ally. Conversely, you might impose disadvantage when a character is in an unfavorable position, such as when they are fighting in a difficult terrain or when they are being hindered by an enemy.\n\n**Advantage and Disadvantage Together:**\nIf a character has both advantage and disadvantage on a d20 roll, they cancel each other out, and the character simply rolls one d20. This is because the advantages and disadvantages are in direct opposition to each other, and they balance each other out.\n\n**Halfling Lucky Trait:**\nThe Halfling Lucky trait allows a halfling to reroll a d20 roll that they have just made if the result is a 1. This can be a powerful ability, as it gives the halfling an extra chance to succeed on a roll. However, it is important to note that the Lucky trait only applies to d20 rolls, not to other types of dice rolls.\n\n**How the GM Can Give Advantage:**\nAs a GM, you can give advantage to a character in a variety of ways. For example, you might give advantage to a character who is using a special ability, such as the *Bless* spell, which grants advantage on the next attack roll. You might also give advantage to a character who is in a favorable position, such as when they are using a high ground advantage or when they are using a special weapon that grants advantage. Additionally, you might give advantage to a character who has the support of an ally, such as when they are using the *Help* action to grant advantage to a companion.", "reference": "Advantage means you roll a second d20 and use the higher result. Disadvantage means you use the lower result. If you have both advantage and disadvantage you are considered to have neither and roll one d20. Multiple situations that grant advantage or disadvantage do not stack; you only roll one additional die. If a halfling’s Lucky trait lets you reroll a d20 while you have advantage or disadvantage, you can reroll only one of the dice, choosing which. Inspiration can also give a character advantage.

The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results. For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs. Typical Difficulty Classes Task Difficulty DC Very easy 5 Easy 10 Medium 15 Hard 20 Very hard 25 Nearly impossible 30 To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM. Contests Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal-for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest. Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding. If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut. Skills Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.) For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding. The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability. Strength •Athletics Dexterity •Acrobatics •Sleight of Hand •Stealth Intelligence •Arcana •History •Investigation •Nature •Religion Wisdom •Animal Handling •Insight •Medicine •Perception •Survival Charisma •Deception •Intimidation •Performance •PersuasionSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill-for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check. For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check. Variant: Skills with Different Abilities Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.", "<2-hop>\n\nUsing Ability Scores Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics: • Strength, measuring physical power • Dexterity, measuring agility • Constitution, measuring endurance • Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory • Wisdom, measuring perception and insight • Charisma, measuring force of personalityIs a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number. Ability Scores and Modifiers Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability. A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30. Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30. Ability Scores and Modifiers Score Modifier 1 −5 2-3 −4 4-5 −3 6-7 −2 8-9 −1 10-11 +0 12 - 13 +1 14 - 15 +2 16 - 17 +3 18 - 19 +4 20 - 21 +5 22 - 23 +6 24 - 25 +7 26 - 27 +8 28 - 29 +9 30 +10 To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down). Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores. Advantage and Disadvantage Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20. If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage. When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1. You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result."], "response": "The d20 system in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a flexible and rich framework for creating contests between characters and monsters that balance mechanical rigor with narrative depth. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to use the system to craft a vivid, lore-driven contest:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Mechanics of the d20 System**\n- **D20 Roll**: The core of the system. A character or monster rolls a d20 and adds relevant modifiers (ability scores, skill proficiencies, situational bonuses, etc.). The result determines success or failure.\n- **Difficulty Class (DC)**: A target number set by the DM (or a monster's ability score) that represents the challenge of the task or contest. A roll must meet or exceed the DC to succeed.\n- **Skill Proficiency Bonus**: If a character is proficient in a skill, they add their proficiency bonus (based on level) to the d20 roll. For example, a 5th-level character might add +5 to a skill check.\n- **Advantage/Disadvantage**: These conditions alter the roll. **Advantage** means rolling two d20s and taking the higher result; **disadvantage** means taking the lower result. These are applied for situational bonuses (e.g., a character with a torch in a dark room has advantage on Perception checks) or penalties (e.g., a character is injured and has disadvantage on Strength checks).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Ability Scores and Modifiers**\n- **Ability Scores**: Each character and monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma), typically rolled using 4d6 drop the lowest. Scores range from 3 to 18.\n- **Ability Modifiers**: Calculated as **(Ability Score - 10) ÷ 2**, rounded down. For example:\n  - 14 = +2\n  - 10 = 0\n  - 8 = -1\n  - 3 = -4\n- **Modifiers in Action**: Modifiers are **always** added to the d20 roll. For example, a character with a +2 Strength modifier rolls a d20, adds +2, and compares the total to the DC.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Skill Checks in a Contest**\nWhen a character and a monster contest a task (e.g., a thief trying to pick a lock while a goblin guards it), both sides roll a skill check:\n- **Character's Roll**: d20 + skill proficiency bonus + ability modifier.\n- **Monster's Roll**: d20 + ability modifier (if the monster has a relevant ability) or a fixed DC (e.g., 15 for a goblin guarding a door).\n- **Outcome**: If the character's total is **equal to or higher than** the monster's DC, they succeed. If the monster's roll meets or exceeds the character's DC, it fails. If both rolls tie, the DM decides based on the situation (e.g., the goblin might block the thief but not catch them).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Example Scenario: A Contest of Wits**\n**Context**: A rogue (Level 5, Dexterity 16, +3 modifier, proficient in Deception) tries to trick a **sphinx** (Intelligence 20, +5 modifier) into revealing a secret. The DM sets a DC 18 for the Deception check.\n\n- **Rogue's Roll**: d20 +3 (Dexterity) +5 (proficiency) = d20 +8.\n- **Sphinx's Response**: The DM sets a DC 18 for the Deception check.\n- **Outcome**:\n  - If the rogue rolls **10** (total 18), they succeed. The sphinx is fooled into revealing part of the secret.\n  - If the rogue rolls **11** (total 19), they succeed dramatically, and the sphinx is distracted enough for the rogue to escape.\n  - If the rogue rolls **8** (total 16), they fail. The sphinx sees through the trick and attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Lore and Flavor Integration**\n- **Skill Selection**: Choose skills that tie into the lore of the contest. For example, a **climber** using Athletics (Strength) vs. a **rock giant** using Strength (Athletics) to crush a bridge.\n- **Advantage/Disadvantage**: Use situational modifiers to reflect the narrative. A character with a **magic shield** might have advantage on saving throws against a **fireball**, while a monster in **poisoned water** has disadvantage on Constitution checks.\n- **DCs as Narrative Challenges**: A monster's ability to resist a spell or outwit a character depends on their **ability scores**. A **dragon** with a high Intelligence (DC 20) is harder to deceive than a **goblin** with a lower Intelligence (DC 15).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Long-Lasting Effects of Ability Modifiers**\n- **Progressive Challenges**: As a quest progresses, the DCs for contests may increase (e.g., a monster's resistance to magic grows as it heals). This reflects the lore of the story (e.g., a lich becomes harder to defeat as its soul regains power).\n- **Character Growth**: As a character gains levels, their ability modifiers and proficiency bonuses increase, making them more capable in future contests. For example, a 10th-level rogue with +5 Dexterity and +7 proficiency might dominate a contest that would have been a challenge at level 5.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Example: A Monster's Ability Check**\nA **medusa** (Wisdom 18, +4 modifier) uses its **Saving Throw** to resist a **charming** spell cast by a bard (Charisma 14, +2 modifier, proficient in Persuasion). The bard sets a DC 16 for the spell.\n\n- **Medusa's Roll**: d20 +4 (Wisdom).\n- **Outcome**: If the medusa rolls **12** (total 16), it resists. If it rolls **11** (total 15), it fails and is charmed.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Creating a Vivid Scene**\nUse the mechanics to enhance the narrative:\n- **Descriptive Language**: \"The rogue's hands tremble as she fumbles with the lock, her Dexterity modifier of +3 barely keeping her from dropping the pick. The sphinx's eyes narrow, its Intelligence DC 18 a daunting wall of logic.\"\n- **Consequences**: If the rogue succeeds, describe the moment of triumph; if she fails, show the sphinx's reaction (e.g., \"The sphinx's voice booms, and the rogue is pinned under the weight of its gaze\").\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe d20 system, when used with attention to ability scores, modifiers, skill proficiencies, and advantage/disadvantage, creates a **rules-based yet deeply flavorful experience**. By tying each mechanical element to the lore and stakes of the quest, you ensure that contests feel meaningful, dynamic, and true to the world of D&D.", "reference": "To run a flavorful contest with the d20 system, start by deciding which ability is relevant to the task. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster tries an action that can fail. The player rolls a d20 and adds the relevant ability modifier. If the total meets or exceeds the DC, the check succeeds; otherwise it fails. In a contest, two participants each roll a d20 and add the same type of modifier. The higher total wins the contest; a tie means no change. Skills are tied to abilities; for example, a Dexterity check can use Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth. If a character is proficient in a skill, the proficiency bonus is added to the check. The proficiency bonus is the same for all skills a character is proficient in. Ability scores range from 1 to 30. The modifier for a score is calculated by subtracting 10 and dividing by 2, rounding down. For example, a score of 18 gives a +4 modifier. The modifier is added to the d20 roll for all checks, saves, and attacks. Advantage or disadvantage changes the roll: roll two d20s and take the higher if you have advantage, or the lower if you have disadvantage. If you have both, you roll only one d20. Special abilities, spells, or inspiration can grant advantage or disadvantage. The halfling’s Lucky trait lets you reroll one die when you have advantage or disadvantage.

Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once. By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check.

The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results. For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs. Typical Difficulty Classes Task Difficulty DC Very easy 5 Easy 10 Medium 15 Hard 20 Very hard 25 Nearly impossible 30 To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM. Contests Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal-for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest. Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding. If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut. Skills Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.) For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding. The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability. Strength •Athletics Dexterity •Acrobatics •Sleight of Hand •Stealth Intelligence •Arcana •History •Investigation •Nature •Religion Wisdom •Animal Handling •Insight •Medicine •Perception •Survival Charisma •Deception •Intimidation •Performance •PersuasionSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill-for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check. For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check. Variant: Skills with Different Abilities Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.", "<2-hop>\n\nProficiency Bonus Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once. By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks. In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply."], "response": "**Wisdom Check for Perception and Proficiency Bonus:**\n- A Wisdom (Perception) check is used to notice hidden details, hear faint sounds, or detect creatures hiding in shadows.\n- **Proficiency Bonus:** If you're proficient in Perception, you add your proficiency bonus to the check.\n- **Expertise:** If you have expertise in Perception, you double the proficiency bonus (i.e., +10 instead of +5).\n- **Rule Against Adding Twice:** You cannot add the same bonus twice. For example, if you're using a different skill that grants a proficiency bonus, you can't add both bonuses to a single check. This applies to both characters and monsters.\n\n**DC for Typical Tasks:**\n- The **DC** (Difficulty Class) for a task is set by the Dungeon Master (DM) based on the challenge of the situation. For example:\n  - Simple tasks (e.g., finding a hidden trap): DC 10.\n  - Moderate tasks (e.g., detecting an illusion): DC 15.\n  - Hard tasks (e.g., noticing a hidden creature in complete darkness): DC 20.\n- The DM may adjust DCs based on the environment, the creature's stealth, or other factors.\n\n**Using Proficiency in Other Skills for Wisdom Checks:**\n- You **cannot** use proficiency in another skill (e.g., Insight, Medicine) to add a bonus to a Wisdom (Perception) check. Proficiency is tied to specific skills. However, if you have a **general ability** (e.g., a bard's \"Inspiration\" or a wizard's \"Arcane Focus\"), the DM may allow creative use, but this is situational and at their discretion.\n\n**Ability Check vs. Contest:**\n- **Ability Check:** A single roll to determine if a character can complete a task (e.g., climbing a wall, hiding). The result is compared to a DC.\n- **Contest:** Two or more characters roll against each other (e.g., a thief trying to pick a lock while a guard tries to stop them). The higher roll wins, and the difference determines success or failure.\n- **Impact on Wisdom Checks:** A Wisdom (Perception) check is typically an ability check. If it becomes a contest (e.g., a character hiding vs. a perceiver), both sides roll, and the result depends on the difference between the rolls.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n- Wisdom checks for Perception are straightforward, with proficiency and expertise bonuses applied as described.\n- DCs are DM-dependent and vary based on the task's difficulty.\n- Proficiency is skill-specific, and contests involve direct comparisons between characters.", "reference": "To make a Wisdom (Perception) check you roll a d20, add your Wisdom modifier, and add your proficiency bonus if you are proficient in the Perception skill.

The DC for the task comes from the Typical Difficulty Classes table: Very easy 5, Easy 10, Medium 15, Hard 20, Very hard 25, Nearly impossible 30.  Monsters also have a proficiency bonus that is used in the same way for their ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.  When a contest occurs, each participant makes an ability check (for example, a Wisdom (Perception) check vs a Wisdom (Insight) check) and the higher total wins; ties leave the situation unchanged.

Here's a structured overview of how armor works for Fighters, its mechanics, and its role in storytelling:\n\n### **Armor Mechanics for Fighters**\n- **Types of Armor**: Fighters can wear **light armor** (e.g., *padded*, *leather*) or **medium armor** (e.g., *studded leather*, *chain mail*), but not **heavy armor** (e.g., *breastplate*, *half-plate*, *full plate*), unless they take the *Heavy Armor Training* feat.\n- **Armor Class (AC)**: Armor provides a base AC, modified by the wearer's Dexterity modifier (if the armor is light or medium). For example:\n  - **Leather** (light armor): AC 11 + Dexterity modifier.\n  - **Chain Mail** (medium armor): AC 13 + Dexterity modifier (maximum +2).\n- **Movement Speed**: Medium armor (like chain mail) reduces movement speed by 10 feet, while light armor (like leather) does not.\n- **Shield Use**: Fighters can use a **shield** (e.g., *tower shield*, *shield*) for +2 AC, but this limits their ability to use two-weapon fighting or cast spells with somatic components.\n\n### **Combat Role of Armor**\n- **Protection**: Armor reduces damage from attacks, increasing a Fighter's survivability in combat.\n- **Mobility vs. Defense**: Light armor (e.g., leather) prioritizes mobility, while medium armor (e.g., chain mail) offers better protection at the cost of slower movement.\n- **Tactical Use**: Shields can be used as cover (e.g., *shove* or *shield bash*), or armor can be used to block or deflect attacks creatively.\n\n### **Leather vs. Chain Mail**\n- **Leather** is lightweight, ideal for stealth or fast combat (e.g., a rogue-style Fighter). It allows full mobility and is less bulky, making it easier to hide in plain sight.\n- **Chain Mail** is heavier but more protective. It slows movement, which can be a trade-off for better defense. It’s suited for front-line combat or situations where high AC is critical.\n\n### **Storytelling Uses of Armor**\n1. **Symbol of Status**: Ornate armor (e.g., a noble’s crest or family sigil) can reflect a Fighter’s heritage, rank, or quest (e.g., retrieving a lost heirloom).\n2. **Prop for Hiding**: Light armor (e.g., leather) can help a Fighter blend into a crowd or disguise themselves (e.g., a disguise kit +10 to Deception).\n3. **Tactical Prop**: A shield can be used as a weapon (e.g., *shield bash*), a barrier (e.g., cover in combat), or a tool for climbing or grappling.\n4. **Narrative Burden**: Armor can represent a character’s past (e.g., a cursed suit of armor) or a moral dilemma (e.g., wearing armor that once belonged to a villain).\n5. **Plot Device**: Armor might be a key item in a quest (e.g., a magical breastplate that grants resistance to fire) or a source of conflict (e.g., a rival Fighter coveting your armor).\n\n### **Example Scenarios**\n- **Leather Armor**: A rogue-style Fighter uses light armor and a shield to avoid detection, sneaking into a fortress and using the shield to block arrows during a skirmish.\n- **Chain Mail**: A paladin or knight wears chain mail to protect themselves in a holy war, using its weight to anchor themselves during a grapple or shield bash.\n- **Shield as Cover**: A Fighter uses their shield to block an enemy’s attack, then follows up with a *shove* to knock the opponent prone.\n\nArmor is more than just a defensive tool—it’s a narrative element that reflects a Fighter’s personality, history, and role in the story.

Here's a breakdown of what this gives you:\n\n- **Leather Armor:** This provides light protection, with an Armor Class (AC) of 11 + Dexterity modifier (up to +2). It allows for mobility and is ideal for characters who need to move quickly and avoid being caught in melee.\n  \n- **Longbow:** A longbow is a ranged weapon that requires no ammunition (since it's a bow), but it does require a free hand to draw it. It deals 1d8 piercing damage and has a range of 150 feet. It is considered a martial weapon, meaning that only a character of 5th level or higher can use it proficiently without disadvantage.\n  \n- **20 Arrows:** These are the projectiles used with the longbow. Each arrow can be used once, so you have a total of 20 attacks before you need to restock.\n\n### How Good is a Longbow for a Fighter?\n\nThe longbow can be a good weapon for a Fighter, but it depends on the specific subclass and playstyle:\n\n- **Ranged Fighters:** If you're building a Fighter who wants to focus on ranged attacks, the longbow can be an excellent choice. It has good damage and range, and with the right feats (like *Distant Shot* or *Martial Archery*), you can make it even more effective.\n  \n- **Melee Fighters:** If you're focusing on melee combat, the longbow might not be the best choice. It requires a free hand to use, and it's not as effective in close combat. In this case, you might want to focus on weapons like swords, axes, or hammers.\n  \n- **Hybrid Playstyle:** If you're building a hybrid character who can switch between melee and ranged combat, the longbow can be a versatile option. However, you'll need to manage your resources carefully and ensure that you have enough ammunition for your ranged attacks.\n\nIn summary, the longbow is a solid choice for a Fighter who wants to focus on ranged combat, but it may not be the best option for a melee-focused character.", "reference": "You get leather armor, a longbow, and 20 arrows.

Alternatively, the monk can choose to take 8 + the Constitution modifier as hit points. The monk's unarmored defense is calculated as 10 + Dexterity modifier + Wisdom modifier. This is because monks are trained in unarmed combat and can use their unarmored defense as a form of protection. The monk can use monk weapons, which are simple weapons that can be used one-handed and are not magical. Ki points are used to power various monk abilities, such as flurry of blows, patient defense, and step of the wind. Flurry of blows allows the monk to make additional unarmed strikes, while patient defense grants the monk a bonus to AC for a number of rounds. Step of the wind allows the monk to move through a creature's space and not provoke opportunity attacks. At level 2, the monk gains the unarmored movement ability, which allows them to move through difficult terrain without slowing their speed. At level 9, the monk gains the unarmored movement ability, which allows them to move through difficult terrain without slowing their speed. Monastic tradition features are gained at level 3, 6, 11, and 17. These features are unique to each tradition and provide different abilities and benefits.

The monk's deflect missiles ability allows them to use their reaction to make an attack roll with their unarmed strike or monk weapon, with the attack roll being a d20 plus the monk's Dexterity modifier, plus half their monk level. The monk's proficiency bonus at level 1 is +2, which is used for the ki save DC.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: KisaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Flurry of Blows Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. Patient Defense You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Step of the Wind You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. Unarmored Movement Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. Monastic Tradition When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Deflect Missiles Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.

Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

You must be wielding a shield. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Second Wind You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Action Surge Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn. Martial Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques, such as Champion. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class. Indomitable Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level. Martial Archetypes Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach. Champion The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows. Improved Critical Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Remarkable Athlete Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use your proficiency bonus. In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier. Additional Fighting Style At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature. Superior Critical Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20. Survivor At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points. Monk Class Features As a monk, you gain the following class features. Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per monk level Hit Points at"], "response": "Monks and Fighters are both highly effective in melee combat, but they approach it differently based on their core class features and mechanics:\n\n### **Monk**:\n- **Unarmored Defense**: Provides high AC (10 + Dexterity modifier + 1/2 level) without armor, emphasizing mobility and flexibility. This makes Monks difficult to hit in close combat.\n- **Martial Arts**: Grants +1 to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes, plus the ability to use Dexterity instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls (a unique advantage for a martial class).\n- **Ki System**: Offers versatility through abilities like **Flurry of Blows** (extra attacks), **Slow Fall**, **Unstoppable Momentum**, and **Stunning Strike**. Ki uses are limited to short rests, though, which can be a drawback in prolonged fights.\n- **Action Economy**: Monks often use **Flurry of Blows** (extra attack) or **Stunning Strike** (disables enemies) to maximize damage or control the battlefield. However, they lack the raw number of attacks per turn compared to Fighters.\n\n### **Fighter**:\n- **Armor Proficiency**: Grants high AC (up to +12 with Heavy Armor and a shield), making Fighters extremely resilient in melee. This is their primary strength.\n- **Fighting Styles**: Options like **Defense** (add Constitution to AC in armor), **Dueling** (+1 to damage with one weapon), and **Protection** (shield allies) tailor Fighters to specific combat roles.\n- **Action Economy**: Fighters excel in sustained combat with **Extra Attack** (make multiple attacks per turn) and **Action Surge** (use bonus actions as reactions). Their damage output scales well with level due to high ability scores and weapon proficiency.\n- **Limitations**: Fighters are less flexible in armor choices (Heavy Armor is restrictive), and their damage depends on weapon proficiency rather than innate martial skills.\n\n### **Impact on Effectiveness**:\n- **Monks** thrive in fast, mobile combat where agility and ki abilities (like **Flurry of Blows**) can overwhelm enemies. Their **Stunning Strike** also disrupts enemy actions, making them ideal for controlling the battlefield.\n- **Fighters** excel in durability and damage output, especially in prolonged fights. Their **Extra Attack** and **Action Surge** make them reliable in scenarios requiring sustained offense or defense.\n- **Trade-offs**: Monks are more vulnerable in extended fights without ki or short rests, while Fighters are slower and less mobile when wearing Heavy Armor. Neither class is universally superior; effectiveness depends on the party’s needs and the combat scenario.", "reference": "A Monk and a Fighter approach melee combat from very different design philosophies, and the information in the two context segments shows how their core features shape that difference.\n\n**Hit Points and Proficiency**\n- A Monk starts with 8 + Constitution modifier hit points at 1st level and gains 1d8 (or 5) + Constitution modifier per level thereafter.  The Monk’s proficiency bonus follows the standard table, starting at +2 and increasing with level.\n- A Fighter also begins with 10 + Constitution modifier hit points and gains 1d10 + Constitution modifier per level.  The Fighter’s proficiency bonus is identical to the Monk’s, starting at +2.\n\n**Armor and AC**\n- The Monk’s class features explicitly state that the character wears no armor and does not wield a shield.  The Monk’s Armor Class is calculated as 10 + Dexterity modifier + Wisdom modifier (Unarmored Defense).  This means a Monk relies on Dexterity and Wisdom to keep AC high.\n- The Fighter, by contrast, is proficient with all armor and shields.  The Fighter can choose to wear chain mail, leather armor, or any other armor type, and can also use a shield.  The Fighter’s AC is therefore 10 + Dexterity modifier + armor bonus (or 10 + Dexterity modifier + shield bonus if a shield is used).  The Fighter also has the Defense fighting style, which adds +1 to AC when wearing armor.\n\n**Weapon Proficiency and Combat Style**\n- The Monk is limited to simple weapons and shortswords (monk weapons).  The Monk can use Dexterity instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes and monk weapons, and can roll a d4 (increasing with level) for the damage of those attacks.  The Monk also gains a bonus action unarmed strike when using the Attack action.\n- The Fighter is proficient with simple and martial weapons, and can choose a martial weapon and a shield or two martial weapons.  The Fighter can also use a light crossbow or handaxes.  The Fighter’s combat style options (e.g., Dueling, Two‑Weapon Fighting, Great Weapon Fighting) modify attack or damage rolls, and the Fighter can use a shield for a defensive bonus.\n\n**Movement and Mobility**\n- The Monk gains Unarmored Movement, a 10‑foot speed increase at 2nd level that grows with level.  At 9th level the Monk can move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling.\n- The Fighter does not receive a special movement bonus, but can use the Step of the Wind ki feature (Monk) or the Action Surge (Fighter) to increase movement or take extra actions.\n\n**Ki vs. Action Economy**\n- The Monk’s ki system provides a pool of points that can be spent on Flurry of Blows (two unarmed strikes as a bonus action), Patient Defense (Dodge as a bonus action), Step of the Wind (Dash or Disengage as a bonus action), and other ki features that scale with level.  Ki points are regained after a short or long rest.\n- The Fighter’s action economy is enhanced by features such as Extra Attack (starting at 5th level, increasing to four attacks at 20th level), Action Surge (one extra action per short or long rest, two at 17th level), and Second Wind (bonus action to regain hit points).  The Fighter also gains Indomitable to reroll failed saves.\n\n**Overall Effectiveness in Melee**\n- A Monk excels in speed, mobility, and the ability to strike multiple times with unarmed or monk weapons, especially when using ki to add bonus actions or to increase movement.  The Monk’s AC relies on Dexterity and Wisdom, so a high Wisdom score is crucial for survivability.\n- A Fighter relies on armor for protection, multiple attacks per action, and the ability to use a shield for defensive bonuses.  The Fighter’s action surge and extra attacks give a high damage output, while Second Wind provides a small self‑heal.\n- In a direct melee encounter, a Monk can outmaneuver a Fighter with superior speed and unarmored defense, but a Fighter can out‑damage a Monk with multiple attacks and armor protection.  The choice between the two classes depends on whether the player prefers a fast, agile, ki‑based combat style (Monk) or a heavily armored, high‑damage, action‑economy‑focused style (Fighter).", "answer_relevancy": 0.8303872726732262, "semantic_similarity": 0.8434727979679072, "bleu_score": 0.12303612430227716, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.18233082706766918, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.260752688172043, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.14017341040462428}

Perfect Self Unarmored Defense Beginning at1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. Martial Arts At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield: •You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strike sand monk weapons. •You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage ofyour unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. •When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon. Ki Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: KisaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Flurry of Blows Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. Patient Defense You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Step of the Wind You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. Unarmored Movement Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. Monastic Tradition When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Deflect Missiles Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack.

Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Second Wind You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn. Martial Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques, such as Champion. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class. Indomitable Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

{"user_input": "Attunement in D&D 5e: What are the lore and flavor implications for a narrativeist looking to weave attunement into a campaign, including how prerequisites, short rest focus, and attunement limits can be used creatively to enhance storytelling and character development?", "reference_contexts": ["Magic Items Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s capabilities in wondrous ways. Attunement Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that class’s spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties. Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words. An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more than one ring of protection at a time. A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed. Wearing and Wielding Items Using a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held. In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn’t adjust. For example, drow-made armor might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped folk. When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t wear boots. Multiple Items of the Same Kind Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can’t normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks. Paired Items Items that come in pairs-such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either."], "response": "**Lore and Flavor Implications of Attunement in D&D 5e:**\n\n1. **Character Limitation and Sacrifice**:  \n   The limit of three attuned magic items (or two if a character is a multiclassed wizard or sorcerer) forces players to make difficult choices. This can mirror a character’s priorities, such as sacrificing a powerful weapon for a defensive shield, or prioritizing a relic tied to their background over a new, flashy item. These decisions can reflect a character’s growth, moral alignment, or evolving goals.\n\n2. **Prerequisites as Narrative Hooks**:  \n   Prerequisites (e.g., class, ability score, or a specific feat) can be used to tie attunement to a character’s backstory or journey. For example, a character might need to complete a quest or prove their worth to a deity to attune to a holy relic, or a spellcaster might require a ritual or knowledge check to unlock an item’s power, weaving the mechanics into the story.\n\n3. **Short Rest Focus as a Mechanical Narrative Device**:  \n   The requirement to focus on attuning an item during a short rest can be used to emphasize the weight of a decision. A character might need to spend time in meditation, prayer, or a symbolic ritual (e.g., touching an ancient tomb) to attune to an item, reinforcing the idea that attunement is not just a mechanical step but a meaningful act.\n\n4. **Attunement as a Story-Driven Mechanic**:  \n   The process of attuning can be made more flavorful by requiring role-playing, quests, or sacrifices. For example:  \n   - *Progressive Attunement*: A character might need to complete a series of trials or quests to attune to an item, with each step unlocking more of its power.  \n   - *Moral Dilemmas*: A character might be forced to choose between attuning to a powerful item that requires a morally ambiguous action (e.g., sacrificing a companion) or leaving it behind.  \n   - *Shared Attunement*: A group of characters might need to attune to an item collectively, requiring teamwork or a shared goal (e.g., a ritual requiring multiple attuned participants).\n\n5. **Limiting Power for Thematic Depth**:  \n   The restriction on attuned items can be used to create tension in a story. For example, a character might be forced to let go of an item they’ve relied on for years, or a party might face a dilemma when only one member can attune to a critical item. This can drive character development, forcing players to confront their values and priorities.\n\n6. **Attunement as a Symbol of Bonding or Trust**:  \n   Items that require attunement could be tied to relationships. For example, a character might need to be attuned by a trusted companion, symbolizing a bond or shared destiny. Conversely, a cursed item might require attunement to be used, creating a narrative risk for the character.\n\n**Creative Use of Mechanics in Storytelling**:  \n- **Quest-Driven Attunement**: A character might need to retrieve a specific component or complete a task to attune to an item, making the process a mini-quest.  \n- **Progressive Power**: An item could start as a mundane object but gain magical properties once attuned, with the story reflecting the character’s growth or the item’s awakening.  \n- **Moral or Ethical Costs**: Attuning to an item might require a character to make a sacrifice (e.g., losing a memory, a relationship, or a part of their soul), adding depth to the narrative.  \n\nBy weaving attunement into the story’s themes, mechanics, and character arcs, a narrativeist can create a richer, more immersive experience that reflects the weight of choices, the cost of power, and the bonds between characters.", "reference": "Attunement is a bond that a creature must form with a magic item before its magical properties can be used. The bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties. Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words. An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more than one ring of protection at a time. A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.", "answer_relevancy": 0.8032264785882539, "semantic_similarity": 0.4476300061490373, "bleu_score": 0.03234245292096216, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.2084623323013416, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.17089678510998307, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.2671957671957672}

The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation. If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue’s Fast Hands can’t be used to activate the item. Command Word A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can’t be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell. Consumables Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. Spells Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item’s description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don’t have a spellcasting ability-perhaps you’re a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature-your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply. Charges Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained. check.

The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane.

Here's a breakdown of the possibilities and implications:\n\n1. **Extradimensional Overlap**:  \n   - The *Bag of Holding* creates an extradimensional space, while the *Bag of Devouring* also creates an extradimensional space that slowly absorbs and destroys anything placed inside it. If the *Bag of Holding* is inside the *Bag of Devouring*, its contents are now within the *Bag of Devouring*'s extradimensional space.  \n   - The *Bag of Devouring*’s effect (destroying items placed inside it) would likely apply to the *Bag of Holding*’s contents, as they are now within its extradimensional space. This would mean the contents are destroyed over time, even though they are inside the *Bag of Holding*.  \n   - However, the *Bag of Holding* itself is not destroyed by the *Bag of Devouring* (as the *Bag of Devouring* is immune to its own effect), so the *Bag of Holding*’s extradimensional space might persist independently.\n\n2. **Mechanical Uncertainty**:  \n   - The rules do not clarify whether extradimensional spaces from nested items overlap or remain separate. If they are separate, the *Bag of Holding*’s contents would remain unaffected by the *Bag of Devouring*’s effect. If they overlap, the contents would be destroyed.  \n   - This ambiguity is a known edge case in the rules, and the outcome would depend on the *Dungeon Master’s* (DM) interpretation of how extradimensional spaces interact.\n\n3. **Practical Implications**:  \n   - If the DM rules that the *Bag of Devouring*’s effect applies, the contents of the *Bag of Holding* are destroyed over time, and the *Bag of Holding* itself remains intact.  \n   - If the DM rules that the extradimensional spaces are separate, the contents of the *Bag of Holding* are safe, and the *Bag of Devouring*’s effect does not reach them.\n\n**Conclusion**: This scenario is a rule-unclear edge case.

The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation. If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue’s Fast Hands can’t be used to activate the item. Command Word A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can’t be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell. Consumables Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. Spells Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item’s description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don’t have a spellcasting ability-perhaps you’re a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature-your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply. Charges Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained. check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn’t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed. Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane. If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane. Bag of Holding Wondrous item, uncommon This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate. Placing a bag of holdinginside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack , portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.

The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance). Arrow-Catching Shield Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement) You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead. Arrow of Slaying Weapon (arrow), very rare An arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both arrows of dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one. Once an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow. Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common. Bag of Beans Wondrous item, rare Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains. If you dump the bag’s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect. d100 Effect 01 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour.

There’s a 50 percent chance that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks. 21 - 30 An animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the s ame plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours. 31 - 40 A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished). 41 - 50 1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout 51 - 60 1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM’s choice. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke. 61 - 70 A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks. 71 - 80 A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM’s choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days. 81 - 90 A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion. 91-99 A pyramid with a 60-- foot-- square base bursts upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the mummy lord’s lair, and its sarcophagus con ta ins treasure of the GM’s choice. 00 A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM’s choice. The top leads where the GM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant’s castle, or a different plane of existence. Bag of Devouring Wondrous item, very rare This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice. The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength"], "response": "When a **Bag of Holding** is placed inside a **Bag of Devouring**, the interaction is governed by the capacities and rules of both items. Here's a breakdown of the mechanics and consequences:\n\n### 1. **Activation and Capacity Limits**\n- **Bag of Devouring**: This item has a 1 ft. diameter opening and can hold up to **500 pounds** of nonliving, nonmagical items. If the weight inside exceeds this limit, the **Bag of Devouring** begins to **devour** the excess items, starting with the heaviest. If the weight is more than twice the limit (1,000 pounds), the **Bag of Devouring** is destroyed.\n- **Bag of Holding**: This item has a 2 ft. diameter opening and can hold up to **500 pounds** of nonliving, nonmagical items. Its capacity is also limited by weight, and it cannot contain living creatures or magical items (unless they are stored in a **Bag of Holding** with a **capacity** of at least 500 pounds).\n\n### 2. **Combining the Two Items**\n- If a **Bag of Holding** is placed inside a **Bag of Devouring**, the **combined weight** of the **Bag of Holding** and its contents is calculated. The **Bag of Devouring** will treat the **Bag of Holding** as a single item, and its contents as part of the total weight.\n- If the **total weight** (including the **Bag of Holding** itself) exceeds **500 pounds**, the **Bag of Devouring** will **devour the excess** items, starting with the heaviest. If the **total weight** exceeds **1,000 pounds**, the **Bag of Devouring** is destroyed, and the **Bag of Holding** is also destroyed if it is inside.\n\n### 3. **Consequences of Overloading**\n- If the **Bag of Devouring** is overloaded (i.e., the total weight inside exceeds 1,000 pounds), it is destroyed. The destruction of the **Bag of Devouring** does not affect the **Bag of Holding** unless the **Bag of Holding** is also destroyed in the process (which only happens if the **Bag of Devouring** is destroyed while the **Bag of Holding** is inside it).\n- If the **Bag of Holding** is destroyed, its contents are released into the **Bag of Devouring** (if still intact) or into the surrounding area (if the **Bag of Devouring** is destroyed).\n\n### 4. **Comparison with Other Extradimensional Storage Items**\n- **Handy Haversack**: This item has a **100 square foot** interior and can hold up to **100 pounds** of nonliving, nonmagical items. It does not have the **devouring** effect, and its capacity is based on **volume** rather than weight.\n- **Portable Hole**: This item creates a **10-foot diameter** hole that leads to a **10-foot diameter by 10-foot deep** extradimensional space. It can hold up to **500 pounds** of nonliving, nonmagical items, but it does not have the **devouring** effect. If the weight inside exceeds 500 pounds, the **Portable Hole** is not destroyed, but items may be lost or damaged.\n\n### Key Differences\n- The **Bag of Devouring** has a **devouring** effect that destroys items if the weight limit is exceeded, while the **Handy Haversack** and **Portable Hole** do not.\n- The **Bag of Devouring** has a **lower capacity** (500 pounds) compared to the **Handy Haversack** (100 pounds by volume) and **Portable Hole** (500 pounds), but its **devouring** effect makes it riskier to use.\n- The **Bag of Holding** and **Bag of Devouring** can interact in a way that the **Bag of Devouring** can **devour** items inside the **Bag of Holding** if the **total weight** is exceeded, whereas the **Handy Haversack** and **Portable Hole** do not have this interaction.\n\nIn summary, the **Bag of Devouring** is more dangerous than the **Handy Haversack** or **Portable Hole** due to its **devouring** effect, and combining it with a **Bag of Holding** can lead to catastrophic destruction if the **weight limit** is exceeded.", "reference": "Bag of Holding is a wondrous item that has no activation requirement; it simply functions as a container.

They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.  You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them.

You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.\nSomeone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.\nAn elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nDust of Sneezing and Choking\nWondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand.

There is enough of it for one use.\nWhen you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating.

When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efre eti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.  The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.\nd100                                                                                                    Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n01-10                                                                                                   The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5  rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle  loses its magic.                                                                                                                                          \n11 - 90                                                                                                 The efreeti serves you for  1 hour, doing as you  command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle,  and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can’t  be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the  bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the  \nbottle is opened a fourth time, the efre eti  escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its  magic.  \n91 - 00                                                                                                 The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for  you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or  after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.                                                                                                  \n\n\nElemental Gem\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the\nconjure elemental\nspell, and the gem’s magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.\nGem             Summoned Elemental  \nBlue sapphire   Air elemental       \nYellow diamond  Earth elemental     \nRed corundum    Fire elemental      \nEmerald         Water elemental     \n\n\nElven Chain\nArmor (chain shirt), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.\n\nEversmoking Bottle\nWondrous item, uncommon\nSmoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud’s area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.\nThe cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.\n\nEyes of Charming\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes.

The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.\nd100                                                                                                    Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n01-10                                                                                                   The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5  rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle  loses its magic.                                                                                                                                          \n11 - 90                                                                                                 The efreeti serves you for  1 hour, doing as you  command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle,  and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can’t  be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the  bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the  \nbottle is opened a fourth time, the efre eti  escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its  magic.  \n91 - 00                                                                                                 The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for  you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or  after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.                                                                                                  \n\n\nElemental Gem\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis gem contains a mote of elemental energy.

When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud’s area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.\nThe cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.\nThe hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet.

The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.\nPlacing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.\nThe haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right\nbefore it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\n\nHat of Disguise\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the disguise self spell from it at will.

The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.\n•As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.\n•As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.\n•As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, youcan use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-footradius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Theflames are harmless to you and the weapon. Whenyou hit with an attack using the blazing weapon,the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.\nRoll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems.

Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.  Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.\n\nHorn of Valhalla\nWondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron) You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker.They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.  Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn’s type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn’s type or determines it randomly.\nd100   Horn  Type  Berserkers  Summoned  Requirement                            \n01-40  Silver      2d4 + 2               None                                   \n41-75  Brass       3d4 + 3               Proficiency with all  simple weapons   \n76-90  Bronze      4d4 + 4               Proficiency with all  medium armor     \n91-00  Iron        5d4 + 5               Proficiency with all  martial weapons  \n\nIf you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.\n\nHorseshoes of a Zephyr\nWondrous item, very rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.\n\nHorseshoes of Speed\nWondrous item, rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature’s walking speed by 30 feet.\n\nImmovable Rod\nRod, uncommon\nThis flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.\n\nInstant Fortress\nWondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.\nThe fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the\nknockspell and similar magic, such as that of a\nchime of opening.\nEach creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.  The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.\n\nIoun Stone\nWondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement) An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color. When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.  A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.\nAbsorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.  Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nAgility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.\nAwareness (Rare). You can’t be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nFortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.\nGreater Absorption (Legendary).While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\nOnce the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nInsight (Very Rare).Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.\nIntellect (Very Rare).Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.\nLeadership (Very Rare).Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.\nMastery (Legendary).Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.\nProtection (Rare).You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.\nRegeneration (Legendary).You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.\nReserve (Rare).This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\nStrength (Very Rare).Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nSustenance (Rare).You don’t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.\n\nIron Bands of Binding\nWondrous item, rare This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.  Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.  A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.  Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nIron Flask\nWondrous item, legendary This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.  You can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.  An identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.\nd100     Contents           \n1 r 50   Empty              \n51 r 54  Demon (type 1)     \n55 r 58  Demon (type 2)     \n59 r 62  Demon (type 3)     \n63 r 64  Demon (type 4)     \n65       Demon (type 5)     \n66       Demon (type 6)     \n67       Deva               \n68 r 69  Devil (greater)    \n70 r 73  Devil (lesser)     \n74 r 75  Djinni             \n76 r 77  Efreeti            \n78 r 83  Elemental (any)    \n84 r 86  Invisible stalker  \n87 r 90  Night hag          \n91       Planetar           \n92 r 95  Salamander         \n96       Solar              \n97 r 99  Succubus/incubus   \n100      Xorn               \n\n\nJavelin of Lightning\nWeapon (javelin), uncommon\nThis javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.\nThe javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.\n\nLantern of Revealing\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern’s bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.\n\nLuck Blade\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement) You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.\nLuck.

This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nWish. The sword has 1d4 - 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the wish spell from it. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.\n\nMace of Disruption\nWeapon (mace), rare (requires attunement) When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage.

If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.\n\nMace of Terror\nWeapon (mace), rare (requires attunement) This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nThe mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nMantle of Spell Resistance\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.\n\nManual of Bodily Health\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Constitution score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nManual of Gainful Exercise\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nManual of Golems\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can’t use a\nmanual of golemsand attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.\nd20      Golem  Time      Cost        \n1 - 5    Clay   30 days   65,000 gp   \n6 - 17   Flesh  60 days   50,000 gp   \n18       Iron   120 days  100,000 gp  \n19 - 20  Stone  90 days   80,000 gp   \n\nTo create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.  Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.\n\nManual of Quickness of Action\nWondrous item, very rare This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nMarvelous Pigments\nWondrous item, very rare Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.   Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons-that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.  When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.  Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.  If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.\n\nMedallion of Thoughts\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThe medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the\ndetect thoughtsspell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nMirror of Life Trapping\nWondrous item, very rare\nWhen this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.\nIf the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.\nAny creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature\nis confined to the cell until freed.\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.\nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature\ntrapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.\n"], "response": "The **Helm of Telepathy** is a rare magical item that allows the wearer to cast three spells: *detect thoughts*, *send*, and *suggestion*. Here’s how to use it and its limitations:\n\n### **Casting Spells:**\n1. **Detect Thoughts** (2nd level, 10 minutes):  \n   - The helm can be used once per day to cast *detect thoughts*. This spell requires concentration and lasts for up to 10 minutes. Once used, the helm cannot cast *detect thoughts* again until the next day.\n\n2. **Send** (1st level, instantaneous):  \n   - The helm can cast *send* once per day. This spell allows you to send a message to a creature within 1 mile, and it does not require concentration. The helm resets its usage for *send* each day.\n\n3. **Suggestion** (2nd level, 1 hour):  \n   - The helm can cast *suggestion* once per day. This spell lasts for up to 1 hour and does not require concentration. Once used, the helm cannot cast *suggestion* again until the next day.\n\n### **Daily Usage:**\n- **Each spell** (*detect thoughts*, *send*, *suggestion*) can only be used **once per day**, regardless of spell level. The helm resets its usage for all spells at dawn (beginning of the day).  \n- If a spell’s duration ends (e.g., *suggestion* ends after 1 hour), the helm can be used again for that spell immediately, as the daily limit is tied to the spell, not its duration.\n\n### **Key Notes:**\n- The helm’s power is limited to **three spells per day**, one of each type.  \n- If a spell requires concentration, the wearer must maintain focus to avoid interrupting the spell’s effect.  \n- The helm cannot be used to cast other spells or exceed its daily limits.  \n\nThis item is ideal for espionage, communication, or subtle influence, but its daily restrictions require careful planning.", "reference": "The Helm of Telepathy is an uncommon wondrous item that requires attunement. While wearing it, you can use an action to cast detect thoughts (save DC 13). While you keep concentration on that spell, you may use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on, and that creature can reply with a bonus action as long as you maintain focus. Additionally, while focusing on a creature with detect thoughts, you can use an action to cast suggestion (save DC 13) on that creature.

The attunement ends if you take off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.\nThe hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. The hammer regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nHandy Haversack\nWondrous item, rare\nThis backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.\nPlacing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.\nThe haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right\nbefore it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\n\nHat of Disguise\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the disguise self spell from it at will.

Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic. You gain the following benefits while wearing it:\n•You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm’s gems of the specified type as a component:\ndaylight(opal), fireball (fire opal), prismatic spray(diamond), or wall of fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.\n•As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.\n•As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.\n•As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, youcan use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-footradius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Theflames are harmless to you and the weapon. Whenyou hit with an attack using the blazing weapon,the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.\nRoll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm.

As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply-using\na bonus action to do so-while your focus on it continues.\nWhile focusing on a creature with detect thoughts, you can use an action to cast the\nsuggestion spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature.

If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.\n\nHorn of Blasting\nWondrous item, rare You can use an action to speak the horn’s command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.  Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.\n\nHorn of Valhalla\nWondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron) You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker.They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.  Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn’s type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn’s type or determines it randomly.\nd100   Horn  Type  Berserkers  Summoned  Requirement                            \n01-40  Silver      2d4 + 2               None                                   \n41-75  Brass       3d4 + 3               Proficiency with all  simple weapons   \n76-90  Bronze      4d4 + 4               Proficiency with all  medium armor     \n91-00  Iron        5d4 + 5               Proficiency with all  martial weapons  \n\nIf you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.\n\nHorseshoes of a Zephyr\nWondrous item, very rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.\n\nHorseshoes of Speed\nWondrous item, rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature’s walking speed by 30 feet.\n\nImmovable Rod\nRod, uncommon\nThis flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.\n\nInstant Fortress\nWondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.\nThe fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the\nknockspell and similar magic, such as that of a\nchime of opening.\nEach creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.  The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.\n\nIoun Stone\nWondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement) An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color. When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.  A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.\nAbsorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.  Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nAgility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.\nAwareness (Rare). You can’t be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nFortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.\nGreater Absorption (Legendary).While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\nOnce the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nInsight (Very Rare).Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.\nIntellect (Very Rare).Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.\nLeadership (Very Rare).Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.\nMastery (Legendary).Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.\nProtection (Rare).You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.\nRegeneration (Legendary).You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.\nReserve (Rare).This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\nStrength (Very Rare).Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nSustenance (Rare).You don’t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.\n\nIron Bands of Binding\nWondrous item, rare This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.  Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.  A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.  Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nIron Flask\nWondrous item, legendary This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.  You can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.  An identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.\nd100     Contents           \n1 r 50   Empty              \n51 r 54  Demon (type 1)     \n55 r 58  Demon (type 2)     \n59 r 62  Demon (type 3)     \n63 r 64  Demon (type 4)     \n65       Demon (type 5)     \n66       Demon (type 6)     \n67       Deva               \n68 r 69  Devil (greater)    \n70 r 73  Devil (lesser)     \n74 r 75  Djinni             \n76 r 77  Efreeti            \n78 r 83  Elemental (any)    \n84 r 86  Invisible stalker  \n87 r 90  Night hag          \n91       Planetar           \n92 r 95  Salamander         \n96       Solar              \n97 r 99  Succubus/incubus   \n100      Xorn               \n\n\nJavelin of Lightning\nWeapon (javelin), uncommon\nThis javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.\nThe javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.\n\nLantern of Revealing\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern’s bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.\n\nLuck Blade\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement) You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.\nLuck. If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nWish. The sword has 1d4 - 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the wish spell from it. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.\n\nMace of Disruption\nWeapon (mace), rare (requires attunement) When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.  While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\n\nMace of Smiting\nWeapon (mace), rare You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the mace to attack a construct.  When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage if it’s a construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.\n\nMace of Terror\nWeapon (mace), rare (requires attunement) This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nThe mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nMantle of Spell Resistance\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.\n\nManual of Bodily Health\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Constitution score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nManual of Gainful Exercise\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nManual of Golems\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can’t use a\nmanual of golemsand attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.\nd20      Golem  Time      Cost        \n1 - 5    Clay   30 days   65,000 gp   \n6 - 17   Flesh  60 days   50,000 gp   \n18       Iron   120 days  100,000 gp  \n19 - 20  Stone  90 days   80,000 gp   \n\nTo create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.  Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.\n\nManual of Quickness of Action\nWondrous item, very rare This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nMarvelous Pigments\nWondrous item, very rare Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.   Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons-that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.  When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.  Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.  If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.\n\nMedallion of Thoughts\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThe medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the\ndetect thoughtsspell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nMirror of Life Trapping\nWondrous item, very rare\nWhen this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.\nIf the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.\nAny creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature\nis confined to the cell until freed.\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.\nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature\ntrapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.\n"], "response": "The **Holy Avenger** is a **+1 weapon** that deals **1d8 radiant damage** on a hit.

Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top. The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.

You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireballspell (save DC 15).

The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional\nvial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.\n\nOil of Sharpness\nPotion, very rare This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultra thin silver shards.

Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.  Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.\n\nPearl of Power\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster) While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot.

Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nPipes of the Sewers\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.\nThe pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called\nswarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.  Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’ music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours.\n\nPlate Armor of Etherealness\nArmor (plate), legendary (requires attunement) While you’re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nPortable Hole\nWondrous item, rare This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.

This potion’s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.\n\nPipes of Haunting\nWondrous item, uncommon\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nPipes of the Sewers\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.\nThe pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called\nswarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.  Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’ music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours.\n\nPlate Armor of Etherealness\nArmor (plate), legendary (requires attunement) While you’re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again.

It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.  If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the\nportable holeor the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed\nportable holecan survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable holeinside an extradimensional space created by a\nbag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\n\nPotion of Animal Friendship\nPotion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you can cast the animal friendship\nspell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will.

The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\n\nPotion of Healing\nPotion, rarity varies You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion’s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion’s red liquid glimmers when agitated.\n\nPotions of Healing\nPotion of …       Rarity     HP Regained  \nHealing           Common     2d4 + 2      \nGreater healing   Uncommon   4d4 + 4      \nSuperior healing  Rare       8d4 + 8      \nSupreme healing   Very rare  10d4 + 20    \n\n\nPotion of Heroism\nPotion, rare\nFor 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour.

Here's a simple breakdown of how the **Oathbow** works and its effects:\n\n### 1. **What is the Oathbow?**\nThe Oathbow is a magical weapon that forces a **sworn enemy** relationship between you and any creature it hits. This means the enemy becomes hostile to you and will actively target you in combat.\n\n### 2. **How to Use It:**\n- When you hit a creature with the Oathbow, you **mark it as your sworn enemy**.\n- The enemy must now **target you** in combat (if possible), and it cannot use the *Help* action to assist allies unless you are out of range.\n\n### 3. **Advantages:**\n- **Ranged Attack Bonus:** While the Oathbow is your *only* weapon, you gain a **+1 bonus to attack rolls** with it. This makes your ranged attacks more accurate.\n- **Enemy Behavior:** Enemies marked by the Oathbow will prioritize attacking you, reducing the threat to your allies.\n\n### 4. **Disadvantages:**\n- **Other Weapons:** If you use any other weapon (or the Oathbow as your *main* weapon), you suffer a **disadvantage on attack rolls** with those weapons. This makes them less effective.\n- **Restriction:** You can only benefit from the Oathbow’s **+1 bonus** when it’s your *only* weapon in play. If you switch to another weapon, the bonus disappears, and the disadvantage kicks in.\n\n### 5. **Why \"Sworn Enemy\"?**\nThe Oathbow’s magic *compels* the creature to see you as a threat. It’s like a magical curse that forces the enemy to focus on you, making you a prime target in combat.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Advantage:** +1 to attack rolls with the Oathbow (only when it’s your *only* weapon).\n- **Disadvantage:** -1 to attack rolls with other weapons (or the Oathbow if you’re not using it alone).\n- **Enemy Effect:** Creatures hit by the Oathbow become *sworn enemies*, targeting you in combat.\n\nLet me know if you want an example of how this plays out in a fight!", "reference": "Oathbow is a very rare longbow that requires attunement.

You can have only one sworn enemy at a time. When you make a ranged attack roll against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll.

The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property. Oathbow Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement) When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, “Swift death to you who have wronged me.” The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn. When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range.

Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour."], "response": "The Nine Lives Stealer is a unique weapon with the following properties:\n\n**Damage:** The weapon deals 1d6 force damage plus 1d6 necrotic damage when used in combat. On a critical hit, it deals an additional 1d6 force and 1d6 necrotic damage. This means that a critical hit with this weapon would result in a total of 3d6 force and 3d6 necrotic damage.\n\n**Charges:** The weapon has a number of charges equal to 3 + the user’s proficiency bonus. Each time you use the weapon’s special property (which is triggered on a critical hit), it consumes a charge. If the weapon has no charges left, it cannot deal the additional damage until it is recharged.\n\n**Immunity:** If the target has immunity to necrotic damage, the extra necrotic damage from the weapon is ignored. However, the force damage still applies as normal. This means that the weapon is less effective against targets immune to necrotic damage, but still deals force damage regardless.\n\n**Usage:** The weapon’s special property is activated only when a critical hit is scored. The user must roll for the critical hit, and if successful, the additional damage is applied. The charges are then consumed as part of the attack. If the weapon is recharged (perhaps through a specific magical effect or item), it can be used again.\n\nIn summary, the Nine Lives Stealer is a powerful weapon that deals significant damage on critical hits, but its effectiveness is limited by the number of charges it has and the immunity of its targets.", "reference": "When you score a critical hit with the Nine Lives Stealer Weapon against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body.

The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy-not the spell itself-is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.\nWhen you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.\nIf you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.\nA newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.\n\nRod of Alertness\nRod, very rare (requires attunement) This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.\nAlertness. While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.\nSpells. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, or see invisibility.\nProtective Aura. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.  The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Lordly Might\nRod, legendary (requires attunement) This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\nSix Buttons. You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.  If you press\nbutton 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head.  If you press\nbutton 2, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  If you press\nbutton 3, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.If you press\nbutton 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press\nbutton 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\nIf you press\nbutton 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\nDrain Life.When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the\nrod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nParalyze.When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nTerrify.While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Rulership\nRod, rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its\ntrusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Security\nRod, very rare While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.  For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).  When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can’t be used again until ten days have passed.\n\nRope of Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.  If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\n\nRope of Entanglement\nWondrous item, rare\nThis rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving\nthrow or become restrained.\nYou can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\n\nScarab of Protection\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)\nIf you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:\n•You have advantage on saving throws against spells.\n•The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, youcan use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.\n\nScimitar of Speed\nWeapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.\n\nShield, +1, +2, or +3\nArmor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield’s rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.\n\nShield of Missile Attraction\nArmor (shield), rare (requires attunement) While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.\nCurse. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.\n\nSlippers of Spider Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.\n\nSovereign Glue\nWondrous item, legendary This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.  One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness, or with a wish spell.\n\nSpell Scroll\nScroll, varies A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.\nIf the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.\nThe level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\n\nSpell Scroll\nSpell Level  Rarity     Save DC  Attack Bonus  \nCantrip      Common     13       +5            \n1st          Common     13       +5            \n2nd          Uncommon   13       +5            \n3rd          Uncommon   15       +7            \n4th          Rare       15       +7            \n5th          Rare       17       +9            \n6th          Very rare  17       +9            \n7th          Very rare  18       +10           \n8th          Very rare  18       +10           \n9th          Legendary  19       +11           \n\nA wizard spell on a spell scrollcan be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a\nspell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 +the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the\nspell scrollis destroyed.\n\nSpellguard Shield\nArmor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks have disadvantage against you.\n\nSphere of Annihilation\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.\nThe sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a\nsphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.\nThe sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.  If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature’s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.  If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.\nd100     Result                                                                                                                                \n01-50    The sphere is destroyed.                                                                                                              \n51 - 85  The sphere moves through the portal or into  the extradimensional space.                                                              \n86 - 00  A spatial rift sends each creature and object  within 180 feet of the sphere, including the  sphere, to a random plane of existence.  \n"], "response": "The **Scimitar of Speed** is a **+1 weapon** that grants the wielder an **extra attack** when they take the **Attack action** on their turn.

At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for\nlightor DC 15 for daylight), ending the blindness on a success.\n\nRobe of Scintillating Colors\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe’s power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the effect ends.\n\nRobe of Stars\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.  Six stars, located on the robe’s upper front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of the stars and use it to cast magic missile as a 5th-level spell. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.  While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.\n\nRobe of the Archmagi\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard) This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe’s color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can’t attune to a robe of the archmagi that doesn’t correspond to your alignment. You gain these benefits while wearing the robe:\n•If you aren’t wearing armor, your base ArmorClass is 15 + your Dexterity modifier.\n•You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n•Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2.\n\nRobe of Useful Items\nWondrous item, uncommon This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment. The robe has two of each of the following patches:\n•Dagger\n•Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)\n•Steel mirror\n•10-foot pole\n•Hempen rope (50 feet, coiled)\n•Sack\nIn addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches.

The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy-not the spell itself-is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.\nWhen you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.\nIf you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.\nA newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.\n\nRod of Alertness\nRod, very rare (requires attunement) This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.\nAlertness. While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.\nSpells. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, or see invisibility.\nProtective Aura. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.  The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Lordly Might\nRod, legendary (requires attunement) This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\nSix Buttons. You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.  If you press\nbutton 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head.  If you press\nbutton 2, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  If you press\nbutton 3, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.If you press\nbutton 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press\nbutton 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\nIf you press\nbutton 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\nDrain Life.When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the\nrod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nParalyze.When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nTerrify.While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Rulership\nRod, rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its\ntrusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Security\nRod, very rare While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.  For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).  When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can’t be used again until ten days have passed.\n\nRope of Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.  If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\n\nRope of Entanglement\nWondrous item, rare\nThis rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving\nthrow or become restrained.\nYou can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\n\nScarab of Protection\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)\nIf you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:\n•You have advantage on saving throws against spells.\n•The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, youcan use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.\n\nScimitar of Speed\nWeapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.\n\nShield, +1, +2, or +3\nArmor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield’s rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.\n\nShield of Missile Attraction\nArmor (shield), rare (requires attunement) While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.\nCurse. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.\n\nSlippers of Spider Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.\n\nSovereign Glue\nWondrous item, legendary This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.  One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness, or with a wish spell.\n\nSpell Scroll\nScroll, varies A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.\nIf the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.\nThe level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\n\nSpell Scroll\nSpell Level  Rarity     Save DC  Attack Bonus  \nCantrip      Common     13       +5            \n1st          Common     13       +5            \n2nd          Uncommon   13       +5            \n3rd          Uncommon   15       +7            \n4th          Rare       15       +7            \n5th          Rare       17       +9            \n6th          Very rare  17       +9            \n7th          Very rare  18       +10           \n8th          Very rare  18       +10           \n9th          Legendary  19       +11           \n\nA wizard spell on a spell scrollcan be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a\nspell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 +the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the\nspell scrollis destroyed.\n\nSpellguard Shield\nArmor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks have disadvantage against you.\n\nSphere of Annihilation\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.\nThe sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a\nsphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.\nThe sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.  If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature’s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.  If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.\nd100     Result                                                                                                                                \n01-50    The sphere is destroyed.                                                                                                              \n51 - 85  The sphere moves through the portal or into  the extradimensional space.                                                              \n86 - 00  A spatial rift sends each creature and object  within 180 feet of the sphere, including the  sphere, to a random plane of existence.  \n"], "response": "**Mechanics of the Rod of Rulership:**\n- **Command Influence:** The wielder can issue commands to others, compelling them to follow orders. This power is particularly useful in both combat and diplomacy, allowing the wielder to gain control over allies or enemies.\n- **Range and Targeting:** The rod's effects are limited to targets within 60 feet who understand the command. This restriction ensures that the rod's power is not absolute and requires strategic use.\n- **Moral and Ethical Implications:** The rod's abilities raise questions about the morality of using force and the responsibilities of leadership. This can create internal conflict for the wielder and the party.\n\n**Limitations of the Rod of Rulership:**\n- **Target Resistance:** If a target is hostile or resistant, the command might not work, or it might require a saving throw. This introduces uncertainty and risk in using the rod.\n- **Potential for Backlash:** Overuse of the rod's powers can lead to resentment or rebellion, especially if the wielder is not respected or if the commands are unjust. This adds a layer of complexity to the narrative.\n- **Dependency on Charisma or Leadership:** The effectiveness of the rod can be influenced by the wielder's charisma or leadership skills, ensuring that the rod is not a guaranteed solution to every problem.\n\n**Flavor Possibilities:**\n- **Moral Dilemmas:** The rod can be used to explore themes of power, authority, and the moral responsibilities that come with them. This can drive the narrative by forcing the party to confront ethical choices.\n- **Plot Device:** The rod can serve as a plot device, perhaps as a reward for the party's heroism or as a cursed item that corrupts its wielder. This can tie into larger story arcs involving divine conflicts or the rise of a new god.\n- **Diplomacy and Role-Playing:** The rod's powers can influence interactions with NPCs, such as subduing a tyrant or converting a reluctant ally. This can add depth to role-playing scenarios and character development.\n\n**Narrative Considerations:**\n- **Balance and Complexity:** The rod's powers should be balanced with limitations to maintain a compelling story. Overuse might overshadow other aspects of the game, such as diplomacy and negotiation.\n- **Character Development:** The rod can be used to explore character growth, as the wielder must navigate the challenges of leadership and the consequences of their actions.\n\nIn summary, the Rod of Rulership offers a rich set of mechanics and narrative possibilities, but its use must be carefully balanced to ensure it enhances the story without overshadowing other elements of the campaign.", "reference": "The Rod of Rulership is a rare item that requires attunement.

On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever."], "response": "The **Staff of Healing** (from *Xanathar’s Guide to Everything*) is a powerful artifact with rich lore and mechanical flexibility. Here’s how you can weave it into your campaign, emphasizing narrative depth and character-driven storytelling:\n\n---\n\n### **Lore and Flavor Details**\n1. **Origin as a Holy Relic**  \n   The staff could be a relic of a fallen deity or a powerful druid who once wielded it to heal the sick and banish curses. Its creation might be tied to a sacred ritual, making it a symbol of divine or natural power. Only those attuned to the forces of healing (clerics, druids, or bards with a connection to life or nature) can wield it, hinting at its sacred or magical origin.\n\n2. **Cursed or Blessed?**  \n   The staff’s daily *remove curse* ability could be a clue to its history. Perhaps it was once cursed, and only the most devout or pure-hearted attune to it. Alternatively, it might be a gift from a celestial or elemental spirit, with the staff’s power tied to a pact or oath.\n\n3. **A Symbol of Balance**  \n   The staff’s *cure wounds* and *remove curse* abilities could represent the balance between life and death, or the harmony between the physical and spiritual realms. Its use might require a moral choice—perhaps healing one soul means sacrificing another, or using its power too frequently draws the attention of a vengeful spirit.\n\n---\n\n### **Narrative Integration**\n- **Quest for the Staff**  \n  The staff could be an artifact sought by a cult, a rival party, or a cursed land. Only a bard, cleric, or druid can attune to it, creating a subplot where characters must prove their worthiness through trials, rituals, or moral choices.\n\n- **Limited Power, Deep Consequences**  \n  The staff’s daily *remove curse* ability could be a key plot device. For example, a party member is cursed, and the staff’s power is their only hope—but using it might awaken a dormant curse or summon a guardian spirit to test the attuned character.\n\n- **A Bond to the Natural World**  \n  If a druid attunes to the staff, it could be tied to a sacred grove or elemental force. Using its powers might require the druid to perform a ritual or sacrifice, deepening their connection to nature and adding stakes to their decisions.\n\n- **A Bard’s Legacy**  \n  A bard attuned to the staff might discover that it was once wielded by a legendary bard who used it to heal a plague. The staff’s power could be linked to a song or melody, requiring the bard to compose a new piece to unlock its full potential.\n\n---\n\n### **Mechanical Synergy**\n- **Strategic Use of *Remove Curse***  \n  The staff’s limited daily *remove curse* ability can be used as a narrative hook—perhaps a curse is tied to a major quest, and the staff’s power is the only way to break it. The attuned character must choose when to use it, balancing the need to heal with the risk of depleting the staff’s power.\n\n- **Attunement as a Reward**  \n  Only allowing clerics, druids, or bards to attune to the staff can reward players for role-playing their class’s themes (e.g., a cleric’s faith, a druid’s bond with nature, or a bard’s artistry). This can create a sense of exclusivity and deepen the party’s connection to the staff’s lore.\n\n- **Flawed Power**  \n  The staff’s *cure wounds* ability might have a drawback—e.g., healing requires a sacrifice (a memory, a relic, or a life), or the staff’s power is tied to a dying deity whose influence is fading. This adds tension and moral complexity to its use.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Storyline Hook**\nA plague has struck a village, and only the Staff of Healing can cure it. The party discovers that the staff is tied to a druidic grove, and only a druid or cleric can attune to it. However, using its *remove curse* power requires a ritual that may awaken a guardian spirit. The party must decide: heal the village, risking a dangerous confrontation, or find another way, even if it means losing the staff to a rival group.\n\n---\n\nBy weaving the staff’s lore, attunement requirements, and mechanics into the story, you can create a compelling artifact that drives both plot and character development.", "reference": "The Staff of Healing Staff is a rare magic item that requires attunement by a bard, cleric, or druid.

On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.\nd100                                              Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n01-05                                             You cast  slow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n06-10                                             You cast faerie fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n11-15                                             You are stunned until the start of your next turn,  believing something awesome just happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n16-20                                             You cast gust of wind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n21 - 25                                           You cast detect thoughts on the target you  chose.

The bonus is determined by the weapon’s rarity.\n\nWell of Many Worlds\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\nYou can use an action to unfold and place the well of many worlds\non a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once\nwell of many worlds\nhas opened a portal, it can’t do so again for 1d8 hours.\n\nWind Fan\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the\ngust of windspell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn’t be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a\ncumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.\n\nWinged Boots\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.  The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren’t in use.\n\nWings of Flying\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement) While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can’t use them again for 1d12 hours.\n"], "response": "The **Wand of Binding** is a rare, magical item in *Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition* that allows its wielder to bind creatures with a powerful, spell-like ability. Here’s a breakdown of its mechanics, risks, and narrative potential:\n\n---\n\n### **Mechanics of the Wand of Binding**\n- **Charges**: The wand has **3 charges**, and it regains **1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn**. Each use consumes 1 charge.\n- **Use**: As an action, the wielder can target a creature within 60 feet that can see or hear them. The target must succeed on a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw** or be **bound** (as per the *Hold Person* spell) for 1 hour. The effect ends if the bound creature takes any damage, or if a spell like *Freedom of Movement* is cast on it.\n- **Limitation**: The wand cannot be used on a creature with 10 or more Hit Dice, or a creature that is immune to being restrained.\n\n---\n\n### **Risks of Using the Last Charge**\n- **Unstable Magic**: If the wand is used with only **1 charge remaining**, the binding effect is **weakened**. The target gains a **+2 bonus to its next saving throw** against the effect, and the duration is halved to **30 minutes**. If the target succeeds on the saving throw, the wand **breaks** and is destroyed.\n- **Cursed Consequence**: If the wand is used to bind a **creature of great power** (e.g., a demon, lich, or ancient dragon), the caster may suffer a **curse** (e.g., a temporary inability to use the wand again or a lingering magical effect tied to the bound creature).\n\n---\n\n### **Narrative Integration and Twists**\n1. **Moral Dilemmas**: The wand’s ability to bind creatures creates **ethical tension**. Should the party use it on an innocent villager trapped by a monster, or on a villain they need alive for a deal? The risk of breaking the wand or causing unintended consequences adds weight to these choices.\n2. **Unintended Consequences**: Binding a creature with the wand might **awaken its rage** or **summon allies**, especially if the target is a powerful entity. For example, binding a demon could trigger a **teleportation** spell or summon a **demon horde**.\n3. **Lore Ties**: The wand could be tied to a **long-lost spellcaster’s legacy**, with its magic tied to a curse or a forgotten ritual. Using it might **activate a trap** or **summon a guardian spirit** that demands a favor in return.\n4. **Twist in a Battle**: In a high-stakes encounter, the wand could be used to bind a **key enemy**, but only at the cost of the wand’s destruction. This forces the party to weigh the **value of the wand** against the **immediate need to defeat a threat**.\n5. **Lore-Driven Limits**: The wand’s inability to bind certain creatures (e.g., undead or elementals) could mirror a **historical failure**—a spellcaster who once tried to bind a god and was consumed by the attempt.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Scenario**\nA party discovers the Wand of Binding in a ruin guarded by a **celestial** (immune to the wand’s magic). They use it on a **demon prince** to prevent a ritual, but the last charge breaks the wand. The demon, now free, reveals that the party’s actions have **unlocked an ancient prison**, unleashing a greater threat.

If the petrification ends, the target is **incapacitated** for 1d4 hours.  \n   - **Immunity**: The Basilisk is **immune to petrification**, so it cannot be affected by its own gaze.  \n\n2. **Bite Attack**:  \n   - **Melee Weapon Attack**: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  \n   - **Hit**: 1d10 + 6 piercing damage.  \n   - **Additional Effect**: If the target is **petrified**, the Basilisk can **use its Petrifying Gaze again** (see above).  \n\n3. **Reflection**:  \n   - If a spell or effect targets **only the Basilisk** (e.g., *Mirror of Life Trapping*), it is **reflected back at the caster**, who must make a **saving throw** (DC 16) or suffer the effect.  \n   - **Limitation**: This only applies to **spells that target only the Basilisk**, not area effects or magical attacks that hit the Basilisk and others.  \n\n### **Tactical Considerations**\n- **Avoid Line of Effect**: The Basilisk’s **Petrifying Gaze** requires a direct line of effect. Use cover, terrain, or spells like *Invisibility* or *Cloud of Daggers* to obscure its view.  \n- **Area Effects**: Use area spells like *Fireball* or *Cone of Cold* to damage multiple enemies and bypass the Basilisk’s petrification immunity.  \n- **Targeting the Basilisk**: Spells that **target only the Basilisk** (e.g., *Mirror of Life Trapping*) can be **reflected back at the caster**, so avoid using them unless you have a high chance of succeeding on the saving throw.  \n- **Damage Types**: The Basilisk is **resistant to cold and lightning** but **vulnerable to radiant or fire damage**. Use magic weapons or spells that exploit these vulnerabilities.  \n\n### **Lore and Behavior**\n- **Reflection Quirk**: The Basilisk’s **reflection ability** is a unique trait that makes it a dangerous opponent in magical duels. If a spellcaster uses a spell that targets only the Basilisk, the effect is **reflected back**, potentially harming the caster.  \n- **Immunity to Petrification**: The Basilisk is **immune to petrification**, which means it cannot be affected by its own gaze or by spells like *Hold Person* or *Slow*.  \n- **Unyielding**: The Basilisk is **resistant to all damage from non-magical attacks**, so use **magical weapons or spells** to deal effective damage.  \n\n### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n1. **Turn Start**: The Basilisk uses its **Petrifying Gaze** on a target within 60 ft.  \n2. **Saving Throw**: The target must make a **Wisdom saving throw (DC 16)**. If failed, they become **petrified** for 1 minute.  \n3. **Combat**: If the target is **petrified**, the Basilisk can use its **Bite attack** (1d10 + 6 piercing damage).  \n4. **Reflection**: If a spell targets only the Basilisk, it is **reflected back** at the caster.  \n5. **End of Turn**: The Basilisk **resists all damage from non-magical attacks** and is **immune to petrification**.  \n\n### **Player Strategy**\n- **Use Cover**: Avoid being in the Basilisk’s line of sight to prevent its **Petrifying Gaze**.  \n- **Area Spells**: Use area-of-effect spells to bypass its **petrification immunity** and **resistance to non-magical damage**.  \n- **Target Vulnerabilities**: Use **radiant or fire damage** to exploit the Basilisk’s **vulnerability**.  \n- **Avoid Reflection Spells**: Spells that target only the Basilisk (e.g., *Mirror of Life Trapping*) can be **reflected back**, so use them carefully.  \n\nThis breakdown ensures that novice players understand the Basilisk’s mechanics, how to avoid its gaze, and how to exploit its weaknesses in combat.", "reference": "A Basilisk is a medium monstrosity that is unaligned.

Its behavior and mechanics are tailored to fit its low difficulty, ensuring it doesn't overwhelm players but still provides a basic combat challenge. Below is a breakdown of how such an orc would function in combat, based on typical D&D rules and the expectations of a CR 1/2 creature:\n\n---\n\n### **Movement and Tactics**\n- **Speed:** The orc moves at a standard speed of **30 feet**, reflecting its agility and ability to navigate terrain quickly. This allows it to reposition during combat or avoid attacks that would otherwise be devastating.\n- **Tactics:** As a low-CR creature, the orc doesn’t employ complex strategies. It will likely charge at a target, attack with its primary weapon, and retreat if threatened. It has no need for flanking or coordinated attacks, as it’s not a significant threat in a group setting.\n\n---\n\n### **Combat Mechanics**\n- **Armor Class (AC):** The orc has a **moderate AC**, typically **13**, achieved through light armor or a shield. This reflects its minimal preparation for combat but still gives it some protection.\n- **Hit Points (HP):** With **8 (1d8 + 1)** hit points, the orc is fragile and can be taken down quickly by even a single hit from a low-level character. This ensures it doesn’t last long in combat, keeping encounters short and manageable.\n- **Actions:** The orc has a **single melee attack**, likely with a **greataxe**, **spear**, or **club**, dealing **1d12 + 3** damage (for a greataxe) or similar. This attack is powerful enough to threaten a single target but not overwhelming for a CR 1/2 creature.\n\n---\n\n### **Special Abilities**\n- **Feral Savagery (Optional):** Some CR 1/2 orcs may have a **simple ability**, such as **Feral Savagery**, which grants **advantage on attack rolls** if the orc is enraged. This ability is flavorful but not overpowered, as it only slightly increases the orc’s damage output and doesn’t require complex mechanics.\n- **No Magic or Spells:** The orc has no magical abilities, spells, or special traits that would elevate its threat level. It relies purely on its physical strength and basic combat skills.\n\n---\n\n### **Role in Encounters**\n- **Solo Threat:** A single orc is a minor threat, suitable for a 1st-level party. It can be defeated quickly, ensuring that combat doesn’t drag on.\n- **Group of Orks:** In a group, orcs can pose a greater threat. For example, **three orcs** (each with 100 XP) would total **300 XP**, which is appropriate for a 2nd-level party. However, each individual orc remains weak, and the group’s effectiveness depends on coordination and numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nA CR 1/2 orc is a simple, agile, and physically strong creature that fights with a single melee weapon. It moves quickly, has a moderate defense, and is fragile in terms of hit points. Its combat style is direct and unrefined, making it a suitable opponent for low-level adventurers. While it lacks the complexity of higher-CR creatures, it still provides a basic challenge that aligns with its 100 XP rating.", "reference": "Orc Challenge 1/2 (100 XP) is aggressive.

Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it\nis carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\nWhile in mist form, the vampire can’t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can’t pass through water.

When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn’t in sunlight or running water. If it can’t transform, it is destroyed.  While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.\nRegeneration. The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water.

The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water. Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the vampire’s control, it takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire’s bite attack.\nEach time the vampire or the vampire’s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.\nChildren of the Night (1/Day).The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn’t up.

This adds tension and strategic depth.\n2. **Tactical Pressure:** The tail attack can incapacitate key characters, creating moments of desperation or requiring healing magic. This highlights the dragon’s physical dominance.\n3. **Dynamic Threat:** The legendary action allows the dragon to adapt to player strategies (e.g., casting *fireball* if players avoid the tail). This keeps the encounter unpredictable.\n4. **Lore and Stakes:** Frame the dragon as a guardian of a sacred site or a tyrant ruling a wasteland. Its actions (e.g., destroying a landmark with its breath) can tie the encounter to the story’s themes.\n5. **Pacing:** Structure the fight in phases (e.g., initial skirmish, ground trap activation, final clash). Use the dragon’s resistances to challenge players’ creativity (e.g., requiring magic or terrain manipulation to bypass fire immunity).\n\n**Example Scene:**  \nThe dragon’s breath weapon reduces a forest to ash, forcing players to fight in a crumbling ruin. Its tail traps a character, creating a time-sensitive objective (heal or escape). The legendary action reveals the dragon’s cunning, as it uses *fireball* to target spellcasters hiding behind cover. The encounter ends with the dragon’s death, but not before its fire trap consumes the battlefield, leaving the survivors to ponder the cost of their victory.", "reference": "A Black Dragon is a chaotic evil, amphibious dragon that can breathe air and water. It has acid breath (a line attack that deals acid damage), a Frightful Presence that forces creatures within 120 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened, and legendary resistance that allows it to succeed on a failed saving throw up to three times per day. In combat it can make a multiattack consisting of a bite, two claws, and a tail attack, each dealing piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage respectively. The dragon also has legendary actions: it can make a tail attack, a wing attack that deals bludgeoning damage and can knock creatures prone, or a Detect action that checks perception. Its resistances include acid immunity, and it has damage resistances to cold and to non‑silvered bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. A narrativeist could highlight the dragon’s acidic breath as a looming threat that scorches the battlefield, use its Frightful Presence to create tension among the party, and employ its legendary actions to keep the encounter dynamic and unpredictable. The dragon’s amphibious nature and ability to breathe both air and water can also be used to set the scene in a swamp or coastal setting, adding atmospheric depth to the encounter.", "answer_relevancy": 0.8565190499264683, "semantic_similarity": 0.38464882554406654, "bleu_score": 0.027035552576084906, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.20113851992409867, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.16825396825396827, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.25}

It is a tactical tool for controlling the flow of combat.  \n  - *Slow* (2nd level): Slowing enemies is a hallmark of Pit Fiends, who relish the torment of watching foes move at half speed. This spell can be used to cripple groups of enemies or force them into disadvantageous positions.  \n  - *Counterspell* (3rd level): A Pit Fiend can negate spells cast by others, ensuring its own survival and disrupting enemy strategies.  \n\n- **Three Uses Per Day (Limited):**  \n  - *Invisibility* (3rd level): The Pit Fiend can vanish into the shadows, stalking prey or evading detection. This spell heightens tension, as players must contend with an unseen, omnipresent threat.  \n  - *Dominate Person* (5th level): A Pit Fiend can bend a humanoid to its will, forcing them to act as its puppet. This spell is a psychological weapon, turning allies into enemies or creating moral dilemmas for the party.  \n  - *Telekinesis* (5th level): This spell allows the Pit Fiend to manipulate objects or hurl them at enemies, adding a layer of physical danger and unpredictability to encounters.  \n\n---\n\n### **Campaign Narrative Integration**  \nThe Pit Fiend’s spellcasting ability can be woven into a campaign to amplify drama and tension in the following ways:  \n\n1. **Psychological Warfare:**  \n   - *Dominate Person* can be used to corrupt a party member, forcing them to betray the group or carry out the Pit Fiend’s bidding. This creates moral quandaries and distrust among party members.  \n   - *Slow* and *Hold Person* can be used to isolate characters, making them vulnerable to the Pit Fiend’s physical attacks or magical traps.  \n\n2. **Environmental Manipulation:**  \n   - *Invisibility* allows the Pit Fiend to lurk in the background, creating an atmosphere of paranoia. Players must rely on spells like *Detect Magic* or *See Invisibility* to locate the demon, adding layers of strategy.  \n   - *Telekinesis* can be used to move objects into dangerous positions (e.g., collapsing ceilings, triggering traps), or to hurl debris at players, making the battlefield unpredictable.  \n\n3. **Tactical Dominance:**  \n   - *Bane* and *Slow* can be used to weaken entire groups of enemies, forcing players to adapt their tactics. This mirrors the Pit Fiend’s role as a master of war and strategy in the Nine Hells.  \n   - *Counterspell* can be used to negate critical spells, such as *Fireball* or *Disintegrate*, ensuring the Pit Fiend’s survival and forcing players to rely on non-magical solutions.  \n\n4. **Moral and Ethical Conflict:**  \n   - If the Pit Fiend uses *Dominate Person* on a non-player character (e.g., a townsperson), the party may face a dilemma: destroy the demon and risk the townsperson’s life, or find a way to free them without harming the Pit Fiend.  \n   - *Hold Person* can be used to freeze a character in place, forcing them to watch as their allies fight the Pit Fiend—a torment that reflects the demon’s sadistic nature.  \n\n---\n\n### **Balance and Roleplay**  \nThe Pit Fiend’s spellcasting is balanced by the limited number of uses for its more powerful spells (3 per day), ensuring that players are not overwhelmed by its magic. However, its ability to use *at-will* spells like *Hold Person* and *Slow* means that it can consistently disrupt encounters, forcing players to rely on creativity and teamwork to overcome its magical prowess.  \n\nIn narrative terms, the Pit Fiend’s spellcasting reflects its role as a cunning, manipulative, and sadistic entity that thrives on the suffering of others. Its use of *Dominate Person* and *Invisibility* underscores its ability to control both the physical and psychological aspects of a battle, making it a formidable and memorable opponent in any campaign.", "reference": "The Pit Fiend’s Innate Spellcasting uses Charisma as its spellcasting ability, giving it a spell save DC of 21.

While \"Redd Drgon\" is likely a misspelling of the classic *red dragon* (a powerful, flame-wielding monster from *Dungeons & Dragons* lore), I can create a creative, detailed background for a unique red dragon variant that blends traditional elements with original twists. Let’s assume you meant a *Red Dragon*—a chromatic dragon known for its fiery breath and role as a classic antagonist in D&D campaigns—but with a unique flavor and lore.\n\n---\n\n### **Name:** **Vyrkhal the Emberfang**  \n**Type:** Red Dragon (Variant)  \n**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil  \n**Size:** Huge  \n**Hit Dice:** 20d12 + 100 (780 hp)  \n**Armor Class:** 19 (natural armor)  \n**Speed:** 40 ft., fly 80 ft.  \n**Ability Scores:**  \n- Strength: 24 (+7)  \n- Dexterity: 14 (+2)  \n- Constitution: 22 (+6)  \n- Intelligence: 12 (+1)  \n- Wisdom: 16 (+3)  \n- Charisma: 18 (+4)  \n**Saving Throws:** Dexterity +7, Constitution +11, Wisdom +8  \n**Damage Resistances:** Fire; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks that aren’t made by a weapon with the *flame* trait.  \n**Damage Immunities:** None.  \n**Condition Immunities:** Poison, exhaustion.  \n**Senses:** Blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 13.  \n**Languages:** Common, Draconic, Infernal.  \n**Challenge:** 20 (18,000 XP)  \n**Actions:**  \n- **Multiattack:** The dragon can use its *Fang* and *Tail* attacks.  \n- **Fang:** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (3d10 + 7) piercing damage.  \n- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage.  \n- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- **Soulfire (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon exhales a cone of searing, soul-corrupting fire. Each creature in the area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 14d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target gains the *Corrupted* condition (see below).  \n**Special Traits:**  \n- **Corrupted (1/day; Legendary Action):** A creature that has taken 14d6 fire damage from *Soulfire* or *Fire Breath* and failed its saving throw becomes *Corrupted*. On its next turn, it must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it gains a *Corrupted* mark. At the end of each of its turns, if it has a *Corrupted* mark, it takes 3d6 fire damage. If it takes 10d6 fire damage, it dies and becomes a *Corrupted Wight* (see below).  \n- **Corrupted Wight:** A corrupted creature dies and becomes a *Corrupted Wight*. A *Corrupted Wight* is a wight that deals 2d6 fire damage instead of 1d6 necrotic damage on its *Frightful Presence* ability. It also has a *Flameform* ability (see below).  \n- **Flameform:** A *Corrupted Wight* can use *Flameform* once per day. As a bonus action, the wight turns into a fiery wisp. While in this form, the wight gains a *Flameform* trait: it can move through fire and can pass through solid objects as if they were air. It can also use *Flameform* to teleport up to 30 feet.  \n\n---\n\n### **Lore and Setting:**\nVyrkhal the Emberfang is a red dragon who once served as a guardian of the **Emberforge**, a legendary forge that creates magical artifacts in the **Flame Mountains**. The Emberforge is said to be powered by the souls of those who dare to enter it, and Vyrkhal was chosen to guard it due to his immense power and cunning. Over centuries, Vyrkhal has grown more powerful, and now he seeks to reshape the world in his image, using the Emberforge to create an army of corrupted creatures and artifacts. His goal is to ignite a new age of fire and chaos, and he will stop at nothing to achieve it.\n\n---\n\n### **Campaign Integration Ideas:**\n1. **The Emberforge Quest:** A group of adventurers must journey to the Flame Mountains to stop Vyrkhal from using the Emberforge to create a weapon of unimaginable power. Along the way, they must face corrupted wights, fiery beasts, and other challenges.  \n2. **The Corrupted Wight Army:** Vyrkhal has created an army of *Corrupted Wights* that roam the land, spreading fear and destruction. The party must find a way to destroy these wights before they overwhelm the world.  \n3. **The Soulfire Curse:** If a character is corrupted by Vyrkhal’s *Soulfire* ability, they may become a *Corrupted Wight* themselves. This can add a unique twist to the campaign, as the player must decide whether to fight against their corrupted self or seek a way to break the curse.  \n4. **The Emberforge’s Secret:** The Emberforge is not just a forge—it is a prison for an ancient fire spirit that Vyrkhal has been trying to free. If the party can find a way to seal the spirit back into the forge, they may be able to stop Vyrkhal once and for all.  \n\n---\n\n### **Flavor and Roleplay:**\nVyrkhal is a cunning and arrogant dragon who sees himself as a god of fire. He speaks in riddles and uses his *Soulfire* ability to corrupt those who dare to challenge him. His lair is filled with the bones of those he has killed, and the air is thick with the scent of smoke and sulfur. He is often accompanied by *Corrupted Wights* who serve as his loyal henchmen, and he is known to summon them to attack those who enter his domain.  \n\n---\n\nThis unique twist on the red dragon adds depth to your campaign, offering a mix of combat, roleplay, and lore that can enrich your D&D experience.

These entities are among the oldest and most primal forces in the world, embodying the raw power of the natural elements. They are not bound by the same rules as living creatures, and their presence can drastically alter the environment around them.\n\n**Origins and Nature**  \nElementals are formed from the raw essence of the world itself. They are not born or raised but rather emerge from the elemental planes, which are the fundamental realms of energy that underpin existence. Each elemental plane—such as the Plane of Earth, the Plane of Fire, the Plane of Air, and the Plane of Water—contains infinite manifestations of its respective element, from the smallest particle to the grandest storm. Elementals are the physical embodiments of these forces, shaped by the will of the planes and the balance of the material world.\n\n**Types of Elementals**  \n- **Earth Elementals**: These beings are massive, slow, and unyielding. They are composed of stone, rock, and minerals, and their presence can cause tremors, quakes, and upheavals in the ground. They are often found in subterranean regions, such as caverns, mines, and underground rivers.\n- **Fire Elementals**: These are volatile, aggressive, and ever-moving. They appear as towering figures of flame, and their very presence can cause wildfires, melt metal, and scorch the land. Fire elementals are drawn to places of heat and destruction.\n- **Air Elementals**: These beings are swift, intangible, and elusive. They are composed of air and light, and their presence can create whirlwinds, sudden gusts, and even lift objects into the sky. They are often found near mountains, cliffs, or in the open sky.\n- **Water Elementals**: These are fluid, adaptable, and cold. They are composed of water, and their presence can cause flooding, drownings, or sudden freezes. They are often found near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and oceans.\n\n**Role in the Game**  \nElementals play a significant role in the world of D&D, both as environmental hazards and as potential allies or enemies. They can be encountered in elemental planes, summoned by powerful spells (such as *summon elemental* or *conjure elemental*), or even tamed through the use of *summon greater elemental* or *planar binding*. In campaigns, elementals can be used to create dramatic encounters, such as a fire elemental causing a wildfire that forces the party to flee, or an earth elemental collapsing a mountain to bury an enemy stronghold.\n\n**Interaction with the Material Plane**  \nElementals are not bound by the same physical laws as living creatures. They can pass through solid matter, resist damage from non-elemental sources, and even reshape the environment around them. However, they are vulnerable to damage from their opposite element—fire elementals are weak to cold, water elementals are weak to fire, and so on. This makes them both powerful and unpredictable opponents.\n\n**Alignment and Intelligence**  \nElementals are generally neutral in alignment, driven by their elemental nature rather than moral or ethical considerations. They are not inherently evil, but their actions can be destructive. Most elementals have low intelligence, as they are bound to the raw forces of their element. However, some may develop rudimentary intelligence or even be corrupted by otherworldly influences, such as the influence of a demon or an archdevil.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nElementals are ancient, primal forces that embody the raw power of the elements. They are both fascinating and dangerous, capable of shaping the world around them in ways that few other beings can. Whether encountered in the wild, summoned by magic, or bound by spell, elementals are a constant reminder of the raw, untamed power that lies beneath the surface of the world.", "reference": "Elementals are large elemental creatures that are neutral in alignment. The four main types are Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. Air Elemental has AC 15, 90 hit points, 0 ft. speed and 90 ft. fly, and it can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide. It makes two slam attacks for 14 bludgeoning damage and can use Whirlwind to fling creatures. Earth Elemental has AC 17, 126 hit points, 30 ft. speed and burrow 30 ft. It can burrow through nonmagical earth, deals double damage to objects and structures, and makes two slam attacks for 14 bludgeoning damage. Fire Elemental has AC 13, 102 hit points, 50 ft. speed, and it can move through a 1‑inch space. It has two touch attacks for 10 fire damage, can ignite targets, and has Fire Form that causes creatures to take fire damage each turn. It also sheds bright light and is susceptible to water.

Here's a detailed breakdown of its attributes and abilities:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Statistics**\n- **Armor Class**: 16 (natural armor)\n- **Hit Points**: 127 (16d10 + 80)\n- **Speed**: 40 ft.\n- **Ability Scores**:\n  - **Strength**: 25 (+7)\n  - **Dexterity**: 12 (+1)\n  - **Constitution**: 24 (+7)\n  - **Intelligence**: 10 (+0)\n  - **Wisdom**: 12 (+1)\n  - **Charisma**: 8 (–1)\n- **Saving Throws**: Strength +10, Constitution +10\n- **Skills**: Athletics +10, Perception +6\n- **Damage Immunities**: Cold\n- **Senses**: Darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 16\n- **Languages**: Giant\n- **Challenge Rating**: 9 (800 XP)\n\n---\n\n### **Combat Actions**\n#### **Multiattack**\nThe frost giant makes two attacks with its greataxe or one attack with its greataxe and one attack with a rock.\n\n#### **Greataxe**\n- **Melee Weapon Attack**: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.\n- **Hit**: 18 (3d6 + 7) slashing damage.\n- **Special**: If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\n#### **Rock**\n- **Melee Weapon Attack**: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.\n- **Hit**: 10 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage.\n- **Special**: If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\n---\n\n### **Notable Traits and Lore**\n- **Frost Giant Strength**: Frost giants are exceptionally strong, with a natural resilience to cold damage. Their hide is thick and resistant to the cold, making them difficult to harm in icy environments.\n- **Solitary and Territorial**: Frost giants are reclusive and solitary, often hunting alone in the frozen wastelands of the **Ice Spires**. They are not social creatures and rarely interact with other beings unless threatened or seeking sustenance.\n- **Weakness to Fire**: Despite their immunity to cold, frost giants are vulnerable to fire. This makes torches, fireballs, or other fire-based attacks particularly effective against them.\n- **Cultural Context**: Frost giants are part of the **Giants** race, a proud and ancient people who once ruled the **Frozen Wastes** before being driven into isolation. Their lore is steeped in tales of their former glory and their descent into solitude.\n\n---\n\n### **Preparation Tips for Adventurers**\n- **Use Fire**: Since frost giants are vulnerable to fire, adventurers should prioritize fire-based weapons or spells.\n- **Avoid Engaging Alone**: Frost giants are powerful and can take down multiple foes with their greataxe and rock attacks. Adventurers should avoid fighting one alone unless heavily outnumbered.\n- **Leverage Terrain**: Frost giants are at a disadvantage in warm environments. If possible, lure them into fire or hot areas to exploit their weakness.\n- **Watch for Solitary Encounters**: Frost giants are solitary, so encounters with them are likely to be one-on-one. This means adventurers must be prepared for a high-stakes, single-target fight.\n\nFrost giants are formidable foes, but their predictable behavior and vulnerability to fire provide opportunities for clever adventurers to overcome them.", "reference": "A Frost Giant is a huge giant that is neutral evil.

The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\nInvisible Passage.The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).

While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and goodspell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag’s soul bag.

The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.\nWhile charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery Mimicry. The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check. Actions Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage. Illusory Appearance. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised. Invisible Passage.The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her."], "response": "The **Invisiable Passag** ability of a *Green Hag* (Monster Manual, p. 133) allows her to render herself and any creature or object she touches completely invisible to all forms of detection, including magical and physical. Here are the key details and limitations:\n\n### **Duration**\n- The invisibility lasts for **1 minute (10 rounds)**, during which the Green Hag can move freely and interact with the environment without being seen. She can end the effect early by ceasing concentration or choosing to become visible.\n\n### **Detection and Limitations**\n- **Magical Detection**: Most spells that detect invisibility (e.g., *Detect Magic*, *True Seeing*) are **ineffective** against the Invisiable Passag. The ability explicitly states that it makes the Green Hag and her touched objects \"completely invisible to all forms of detection,\" including magical ones. However, spells that directly target magical effects (e.g., *Dispel Magic*, *Counterspell*) or have descriptions that override this (e.g., *Mind Flayer’s Detect Magic*) could potentially end or bypass the effect.\n- **Physical Detection**: The Green Hag is invisible to all natural sight, even to creatures with abilities like *truesight* or *blindsight*. This means she cannot be tracked visually, even by creatures that can normally see invisible beings.\n- **Tracking**: While the ability prevents tracking through sight or magical detection, **non-magical tracking** (e.g., following a trail of magical residue or physical evidence) is still possible if the Green Hag leaves behind detectable traces. However, the invisibility likely prevents her from being tracked through direct observation or magical means.\n\n### **Effect on Equipment**\n- Any **creature or object** the Green Hag touches while using Invisiable Passag becomes invisible as well. This includes her **gear**, weapons, and other items. Thus, her equipment is hidden from view, making it difficult for enemies to target or interact with it while the ability is active.\n\n### **Key Considerations**\n- The ability is a **concentration spell-like effect**, meaning it can be disrupted by *Dispel Magic* or other spells that end concentration-based effects.\n- The Green Hag can use this ability to **evade combat**, hide in plain sight, or move undetected through hostile environments. However, its duration is limited, and she must remain within 10 feet of the objects or creatures she wishes to make invisible.\n\nIn summary, the Invisiable Passag is a powerful and nearly foolproof ability, but its effectiveness depends on the Green Hag’s ability to maintain concentration and avoid high-level magic that directly counters magical invisibility.", "reference": "The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).

When a creature that can see the medusa’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restorationspell or other magic.  Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.\n\nActions\nMultiattack.

What is the Shapechanger Trait?**  \nA shapechanger (e.g., a **weretiger**) can shift its form between two states: a **humanoid (human)** and a **beast (tiger)**. This is a supernatural ability, not a spell, and requires **1 action** to initiate.  \n\n**2. How Does It Work?**  \n- **Transformation:** Once per **short rest**, the creature can change its form. The transformation is **instantaneous** and does not require concentration.  \n- **Form Options:** Weretigers shift between a **humanoid human** and a **tiger** (or another beast, depending on the specific lycanthropy variant). The creature retains its **personality, memories, and intelligence** in both forms.  \n- **Stats in Each Form:**  \n  - **Humanoid Form (Human):**  \n    - **Strength** is reduced (e.g., 16 for a weretiger, down from 21 in beast form).  \n    - **Dexterity** and **Intelligence** are increased (e.g., Dexterity 18, Intelligence 16).  \n  - **Beast Form (Tiger):**  \n    - **Strength** is maximized (e.g., 21 for a weretiger).  \n    - **Dexterity** and **Intelligence** are reduced (e.g., Dexterity 10, Intelligence 8).  \n  - **Ability Scores:** The creature’s stats change based on its form, but **hit points, armor class, and other traits** are consistent.  \n\n**3. Equipment and Transformation**  \n- **Equipment is Shed:** When a shapechanger shifts to beast form, all **nonmagical, non-attached equipment** is discarded (e.g., armor, weapons, or clothing).  \n- **Magical Items:** These remain with the creature in any form, but **magical weapons or armor** may not function in beast form (e.g., a sword is dropped but retained).  \n\n**4. Death and Transformation**  \n- If a shapechanger dies, it **remains in its last form** (e.g., as a tiger). It does not revert to its humanoid form after death.  \n\n**5. Lore Reference (Quick):**  \nWeretigers are **natural shapechangers**, not cursed lycanthropes (as in *Manual of the Arcane*). They are linked to **tiger deities or spirits** in some settings, and their lycanthropy is a **gift or curse** depending on the campaign. In *Volo’s Guide to Monsters*, weretigers are often **guardians of sacred places** or **villains with a tragic past**.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nShapechanger allows a weretiger to shift between human and tiger forms, with stats and equipment adjusting accordingly.

Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people. Squalid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease. Poor. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types. Modest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like. Comfortable. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers. Wealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants. Aristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need.

The lifestyle rules are in the *Player's Handbook* on page 154, and they provide a list of the minimum income required to maintain a certain lifestyle, and they vary based on the type of lifestyle and the size of the settlement in which you live.\n\nIn the *Player’s Handbook*, the standard lifestyle expenses are:\n\n- **Poor:** 1 sp per person per day\n- **Moderate:** 2 sp per person per day\n- **Comfortable:** 5 sp per person per day\n- **Rich:** 15 sp per person per day\n\nThese amounts are for a single person. If you have a party or a group, the amount is multiplied by the number of people in the group. For example, if you have a group of four people living a comfortable lifestyle, you would need 20 sp per day (5 sp × 4 people).\n\nThese lifestyle expenses cover the basic needs of a character, such as food, shelter, and clothing, and they are based on the assumption that the character is living a certain lifestyle in a given area. If a character is living in a more expensive area, such as a large city, the lifestyle expenses may be higher.\n\nThese lifestyle expenses can be covered by a character's income, which can come from a variety of sources, such as a salary, adventuring, or other means.

Self-Sufficiency The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford-paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.

Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills. Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke. Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation. Services Service Pay Coach cab Between towns 3 cp per mile Within a city 1 cp Hireling Skilled 2 gp per day Untrained 2 sp per day Messenger 2 cp per mile Road or gate toll 1 cp Ship’s passage 1 sp per mile Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers. Spellcasting Services People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs. Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure woundsor identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment-the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement."], "response": "Adventurers can strategically employ hirelings and services to balance lifestyle expenses and readiness by prioritizing efficiency, resource management, and situational adaptability. Here's a structured approach:\n\n### **1. Hirelings for Urban Readiness**\n- **Guards/Watchmen**: Protect party bases, reduce risks of theft or ambush in cities. Cheaper than hiring full-time mercenaries but effective for low-threat areas.\n- **Servants/Cooks**: Reduce time spent on mundane tasks (e.g., food prep, cleaning), freeing resources for exploration or combat.\n- **Couriers/Telepathic Services**: For communication across distances, use magical services (e.g., *Sending* spells) or hire couriers to avoid carrying heavy, time-consuming logistics.\n\n### **2. Hirelings for Wilderness Readiness**\n- **Guides/Trackers**: Essential for navigation in unfamiliar terrain. A guide can save time and prevent costly detours, while trackers can locate resources or avoid dangers.\n- **Beast Handlers/Animal Companions**: Provide utility in wilderness (e.g., scouting, hunting), reducing the need to carry extra supplies or risk starvation.\n- **Alchemical/Magical Services**: Hire alchemists or use pre-made potions to ensure preparedness for environmental hazards (e.g., potions for poison resistance, fireproof gear).\n\n### **3. Cost-Effective Service Use**\n- **Leverage Local Markets**: Purchase supplies in cities (e.g., arrows, food) at lower prices than in wilderness, then store them for use on expeditions.\n- **Negotiate Recurring Contracts**: Hire guards or guides for fixed periods (e.g., 10 days) at discounted rates, avoiding per-day expenses.\n- **Use Magical Items as Alternatives**: Invest in spells (*Find Familiar*, *Telekinesis*) or items (*Portable Hole*, *Mages' Magnificent Mansion*) to reduce reliance on hirelings for storage or travel.\n\n### **4. Balance Lifestyle Expenses**\n- **Track Income vs. Expenditure**: Use *Identify* or *Detect Magic* to assess the value of services before hiring. Avoid overpaying for redundant roles (e.g., hiring a guard if the party has *Protection from Magic*).\n- **Rotate Hirelings**: Replace hirelings regularly to avoid long-term costs (e.g., a 10-day guard contract is cheaper than a full-time retainer).\n- **Use Party Skills**: Let skilled members (e.g., a bard with *Calm Animals*) handle tasks like managing animals, reducing the need for hirelings.\n\n### **5. Adaptive Readiness**\n- **Urban Focus**: Invest in services that reduce downtime (e.g., *Haste* for faster quests, *Town Portal* for travel).\n- **Wilderness Focus**: Prioritize hirelings with survival skills (e.g., a *Druid* for terrain knowledge, a *Ranger* for tracking). Use *Invisibility* or *Invisibility Cloak* to avoid ambushes instead of hiring guards.\n\n### **Example Strategy**\n- **Urban Campaign**: Hire a cook (1d4 gp/day) and guards (1d6 gp/day) for 10 days, using saved gold to buy supplies for wilderness expeditions. Use *Sending* spells for communication.\n- **Wilderness Campaign**: Employ a guide (2d4 gp/day) and a beast handler (1d6 gp/day) for 10 days. Use *Find Familiar* to scout ahead and *Identify* to assess service costs.\n\nBy aligning hireling and service choices with the party’s current environment, budget, and goals, adventurers can maintain readiness without draining resources.", "reference": "Adventurers can pay non‑player characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. Channel Divinity Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra A ttack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Aura of Protection Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Aura of Courage Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Improved Divine Smite By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. Cleansing Touch Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. Sacred Oaths Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart. Oath of Devotion The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. Tenets of Devotion Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets. Honesty.Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise. Courage.Never fear to act, though caution is wise. Compassion.Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom. Honor.Treat others with fairness, and"], "response": "The **Oath of Devotion** is one of the three main paladin subclasses in *Dungeons & Dragons* (5th edition), representing the most traditional and lawful type of paladin. Paladins who swear this oath are bound to serve a deity or a lawful cause, upholding the tenets of their faith with unwavering loyalty and righteousness.\n\n### Tenets of the Oath of Devotion:\n1. **Honor and Loyalty**: Devoted paladins are bound to their oaths and the laws of their deity or the cause they serve. They act with honor, never betraying their allies or breaking their promises.\n2. **Justice and Fairness**: They uphold the law, ensuring that justice is served and that the weak are protected from the strong.\n3. **Protection of the Innocent**: They fight to defend the innocent and vulnerable, ensuring that no one is harmed without just cause.\n4. **Purity of Purpose**: Their actions are driven by a clear moral code, and they do not allow personal ambition or corruption to cloud their judgment.\n5. **Service to a Higher Power**: They serve their deity or the lawful order with unwavering dedication, often sacrificing personal desires for the greater good.\n6. **Rejection of Corruption**: They abhor any form of corruption, whether it comes from demons, devils, or the misuse of power.\n7. **Unity and Fellowship**: They value the bonds of fellowship and work alongside their allies, never acting alone if it endangers others.\n8. **Moral Integrity**: They adhere to a strict moral code, often refusing to compromise their principles, even in the face of adversity.\n9. **Duty to the Law**: They see themselves as enforcers of the law, ensuring that justice is served and that the weak are protected.\n10. **Righteousness Through Action**: Their righteousness is not just a belief but a way of life, expressed through their actions and deeds.\n\nThese tenets are not strict rules but guiding principles that shape the paladin's behavior and choices.

Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. Turn the Unholy.As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Aura of Devotion Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Purity of Spirit Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and goodspell. Holy Nimbus At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Breaking Your Oath A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all--night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self--denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another."], "response": "\"Turn the Unholy\" is a term that appears in certain Dungeons & Dragons supplements, particularly those involving divine magic and the conflict between good and evil. It is a **reaction** or **ability** that allows a character (typically a **cleric** or **paladin**) to **repel or harm unholy creatures**, such as **demons**, **devils**, or other **corrupted beings** that are not undead but are still tied to evil or corruption.\n\n### Key Mechanics (from official lore and supplements):\n- **Clerics and Paladins**: These classes often have abilities to turn or repel unholy entities. For example, in *Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes*, clerics have the **\"Turn the Unholy\"** ability, which functions similarly to **turning undead** but targets **unholy creatures** instead.\n- **Reaction**: The ability is typically used as a **reaction** when an unholy creature is within 60 feet of the character.\n- **DC Check**: The character makes a **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check** or a **spellcasting ability check**. If successful, the unholy creature must make a **Wisdom saving throw** or be forced to **flee** or **take damage** (depending on the source material).\n- **Damage**: If the unholy creature fails its saving throw, it takes **1d8 radiant damage** (or a similar effect, depending on the edition or supplement).\n\n### Lore Context:\n- **Unholy creatures** are often associated with **corruption**, **evil**, or **chaos**, such as **demons**, **devils**, or **corrupted beasts**.\n- The ability reflects the **divine power** of clerics and paladins to **purify** or **repel** such entities, contrasting with the **undead** (which are often tied to necromancy or darkness).\n\n### Notes:\n- Specific details may vary depending on the **supplement** or **campaign setting** being used. For example, *Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes* provides detailed mechanics for **turning the unholy**, while other sources (like *Volo’s Guide to Monsters*) may describe unholy creatures differently.\n- This ability is often used in **high-level campaigns** or **mythic encounters** where unholy forces are a major threat.\n\nIf you’re using a specific supplement or campaign, check its rules for precise details.", "reference": "Turn the Unholy is a Channel Divinity option that allows a paladin to present their holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallowspell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. Lay on Hands Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Spellcasting By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. Preparing and Casting Spells The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells whenyou finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures. Natural Explorer You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in. While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits: •Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel. •Your group can’t become lost except by magical means. •Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. •If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. •When you forage, you find twice as much food asyou normally would. •While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.You choose additional favored terrain types at 6thand 10th level. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options.

Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Spellcasting By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. Spell Slots The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendshipusing either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus +your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus +your Wisdom modifier Ranger Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate, such as the Hunter. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Primeval Awareness Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Land’s Stride Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. Hide in Plain Sight Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself.

Divine Health By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease. Sacred Oath When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature. Oath Spells Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. Channel Divinity Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. Cleansing Touch Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. Sacred Oaths Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart. Oath of Devotion The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallowspell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. Lay on Hands Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Spellcasting By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. Preparing and Casting Spells The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. Turn the Unholy.As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Aura of Devotion Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Purity of Spirit Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and goodspell. Holy Nimbus At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Breaking Your Oath A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all--night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self--denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.", "<2-hop>\n\nPaladin Class Features As a paladin, you gain the following class features.

Here’s how they function individually and how they combine:\n\n---\n\n### **Aura of Protection** (Paladin class feature)\n- **Radius**: 30 feet.\n- **Effect**: Grants all allies within the aura a **+2 bonus to AC** and **+2 bonus to saves** against **spells and other magical effects**.\n- **Scaling**: The bonus scales with the paladin’s level, increasing by +1 per 2 levels (e.g., +3 at 6th level, +5 at 10th, etc., up to a maximum of +10 at 20th level).\n- **Purpose**: This is the paladin’s primary defensive aura, providing **melee and spell protection** for allies in a large radius. It’s ideal for shielding a group of allies in combat.\n\n---\n\n### **Aura of Devotion** (Paladin class feature)\n- **Radius**: 10 feet.\n- **Effect**: Grants all allies within the aura a **+1 bonus to AC** and **+1 bonus to saves** against **spells and other magical effects**.\n- **Scaling**: The bonus scales with the paladin’s level, increasing by +1 per 2 levels (e.g., +2 at 6th level, +3 at 10th, etc., up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).\n- **Purpose**: This is a **focused, close-range aura** that provides **light but reliable protection** for allies in immediate proximity. It’s useful for protecting oneself or a small group in tight quarters.\n\n---\n\n### **How They Combine**\n- **Stacking**: When a paladin is within the **overlapping area** of both auras (e.g., in the 10-foot radius of *Aura of Devotion* and within the 30-foot radius of *Aura of Protection*), the **bonuses stack**. For example:\n  - A 10th-level paladin would grant:\n    - **+5 to AC** (from *Aura of Protection*).\n    - **+2 to saves** (from *Aura of Protection*).\n    - **+3 to AC** (from *Aura of Devotion*).\n    - **+1 to saves** (from *Aura of Devotion*).\n    - **Total: +8 to AC and +3 to saves**.\n- **Strategic Use**: *Aura of Devotion* is ideal for **close combat** (e.g., protecting a tank or yourself in melee), while *Aura of Protection* covers **larger groups** in open combat. Together, they create a **layered defense** that adapts to different combat scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaway**\n- **Aura of Protection** is the **core defensive ability**, providing strong, area-wide protection.\n- **Aura of Devotion** is a **complementary, focused ability** that enhances protection in close quarters.\n- Combined, they make the paladin an **unmatched protector**, capable of shielding allies in both **melee and ranged scenarios**.", "reference": "Aura of Devotion is a feature that starts at 7th level and protects you and friendly creatures within 10 feet from being charmed while you are conscious.

{"user_input": "Which artisan tool proficiency can a dwarf select that includes Brewer\\'s supplies, and how does this choice reflect their cultural background?", "reference_contexts": ["Races Racial Traits The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races. Ability Score Increase Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores. Age The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom. Alignment Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character. Size Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.” Speed Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling ( “Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”). Languages By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Subraces Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world. Dwarf Dwarf Traits Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature. Ability Score Increase.Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years. Alignment. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order. Size.Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed.Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor. Darkvision.Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Dwarven Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. Dwarven Combat Training.You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer. Tool Proficiency.You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools. Stonecunning. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. Languages.You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Languages.You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires. High Elf As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races. Ability Score Increase.Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. Cantrip.You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice. Halfling Halfling Traits Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings. Ability Score Increase.Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century. Alignment.Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways. Size.Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed.Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Lucky.When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Brave.You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. Halfling Nimbleness. You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling. Lightfoot As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others. Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1.

Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos.

You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.

After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Languages.You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires. High Elf As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves.

You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling. Lightfoot As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others.

{"user_input": "Elf and human who can speak elvish?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nElf Elf Traits Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Languages.You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires. High Elf As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races. Ability Score Increase.Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. Cantrip.You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice. Halfling Halfling Traits Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings. Ability Score Increase.Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century. Alignment.Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways. Size.Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed.Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Lucky.When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Brave.You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. Halfling Nimbleness. You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling. Lightfoot As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others. Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1. Naturally Stealthy. You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.", "<2-hop>\n\nHuman Human Traits It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits. Ability Score Increase. Your ability scores each increase by 1. Age. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century. Alignment. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them. Size. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on."], "response": "In Dungeons & Dragons, elves naturally speak Elvish, as it is their native language.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit. Sneak Attack Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. Thieves’ Cant During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. Cunning Action Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. Roguish Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities, such as Thief. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Uncanny Dodge Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you. Evasion Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Reliable Talent By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. Blindsense Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. Slippery Mind By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. Elusive Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated. Stroke of Luck At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Roguish Archetypes Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques. Thief You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators.

A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. Distant Spell When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

Draconic Bloodline Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance. Dragon Ancestor At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor.

You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. Draconic Presence Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit. Sneak Attack Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. Thieves’ Cant During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. Cunning Action Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. Roguish Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities, such as Thief. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Uncanny Dodge Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you. Evasion Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Reliable Talent By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. Blindsense Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. Slippery Mind By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. Elusive Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated. Stroke of Luck At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.  Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.  Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.\n\nCreating Sentient Magic Items\nWhen you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.\n\nAbilities\nA sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.\n\nCommunication\nA sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.\nd100   Communication                                                                                                                                                          \n01-60  The item communicates by transmitting emotion  to the creature carrying or wielding it.                                                                                \n61-90  The item can speak, read, and understand one  or more languages.                                                                                                       \n91-00  The item can speak, read, and understand one  or more languages. In addition, the item can  communicate telepathically with any character  that carries or wields it.  \n\n\nSenses\nWith sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table.\nd4  Senses                                      \n1   Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.   \n2   Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet    \n3   Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet.  \n4   Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.     \n\n\nAlignment\nA sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table.\nd100     Alignment        d100     Alignment        \n01 - 15  Lawful good      74 - 85  Chaotic neutral  \n16 - 35  Neutral good     86 - 89  Lawful evil      \n36 - 50  Chaotic good     90 - 96  Neutral evil     \n51 - 63  Lawful  neutral  97 - 00  Chaotic evil     \n64 - 73  Neutral          \n\n\nSpecial Purpose\nYou can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You\ncan pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.\nd10  Purpose                                                                                                                                   \n1    Aligned:  The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a  diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is  never neutral.)              \n2    Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of  a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls,  or wizards.            \n3    Pro tector:  The item seeks to defend a particular race  or kind of creature, such as elves or druids.                                    \n4    Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or  destroy the servants of a particular deity.                                               \n5    Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and  interests o f a particular deity.                                                     \n6    Destroyer: The item craves destruction and goads its  user to fight arbitrarily.                                                          \n7    Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the greatest  magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a  famous or notorious figure.  \n8    Lore  Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is  determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or  unravel a cryptic prophecy.             \n9    Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its  wielder have key roles to play in future events.                                   \n10   Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and wants  to understand why it was created.                                                   \n\n\nConflict\nA sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:\n•The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.\n•The item demands that its wielder dispose ofanything the item finds repugnant.\n•The item demands that its wielder pursue theitem’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.\n•The item demands to be given to someone else.If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’swishes, the item can do any or all of the following:\n•Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.\n•Suppress one or more of its activated properties.\n•Attempt to take control of its wielder.If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn.\n\nArtifacts\n\nOrb of Dragonkind\nWondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)\nAges past,elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five\nOrbs of Dragonkind\n(or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow\nsome measure of control over dragons.\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma\ncheck. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts\nsuggestionon you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the\nworld, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\nRandom Properties. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:\n•2 minor beneficial properties\n•1 minor detrimental property\n•1 major detrimental property\nSpells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18)from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges),or scrying (3 charges).You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.\nCall Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.\nDestroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.\n\n\nMonsters\nA monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its\nstat block, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.\n\nSize\nA monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the Player’s Handbook for more information on creature size and space.\n\nSize Categories\nSize        Space                   Examples             \nTiny        2½ by 2½ ft.            Imp, sprite          \nSmall       5 by 5 ft.              Giant rat, goblin    \nMedium      5 by 5 ft.              Orc, werewolf        \nLarge       10 by 10 ft.            Hippogriff, ogre     \nHuge        15 by 15 ft.            Fire giant, treant   \nGargantuan  20 by 20 ft. or larger  Kraken, purple worm  \n\n\nModifying Creatures\nDespite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a\nvariant or\ntemplate, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.\n\nType\nA monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.  The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.\nAberrations are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.\nBeasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.\nCelestialsare creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.\nConstructsare made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.\nDragonsare large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.\nElementals are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers and invisible stalkers.\nFeyare magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.\nFiendsare creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.\nGiants tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.\nHumanoids are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.\nMonstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense-frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.\nOozes are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.\nPlants in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.\nUndead are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.\n\nTags\nA monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.\n\nAlignment\nA monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack\ncharacters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the\nPlayer’s Handbookfor descriptions of the different alignments.\nThe alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change\na monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.\nSome creatures can have\nany alignment. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.\nMany creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are\nunaligned, which means they don’t have an alignment.\n\nArmor Class\nA monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.\n\nHit Points\nA monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the\nPlayer’s Handbook.\nA monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).\nA monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.\n\nHit Dice by Size\nMonster Size  Hit Die  Average HP per Die  \nTiny          d4       2½                  \nSmall         d6       3½                  \nMedium        d8       4½                  \nLarge         d10      5½                  \nHuge          d12      6½                  \nGargantuan    d20      10½                 \n\nA monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).\n\nSpeed\nA monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the Player’s Handbook.  All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.  Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.\n\nBurrow\nA monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.\n\nClimb\nA monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.\n\nFly\nA monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to\nhover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the Player’s Handbook). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.\n\nSwim\nA monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.\n\nAbility Scores\nEvery monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used in play, see the\nPlayer’s Handbook.\n\nSaving Throws\nThe Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.\nA saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).\n\nProficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating\nChallenge  Proficiency  Bonus  Challenge  Proficiency  Bonus  \n0          +2                  14         +5                  \n1/8        +2                  15         +5                  \n1/4        +2                  16         +5                  \n1/2        +2                  17         +6                  \n1          +2                  18         +6                  \n2          +2                  19         +6                  \n3          +2                  20         +6                  \n4          +2                  21         +7                  \n5          +3                  22         +7                  \n6          +3                  23         +7                  \n7          +3                  24         +7                  \n8          +3                  25         +8                  \n9          +4                  26         +8                  \n10         +4                  27         +8                  \n11         +4                  28         +8                  \n12         +4                  29         +9                  \n13         +5                  30         +9                  \n\n\nSkills\nThe Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\nA skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a\nmonster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.\n\nVulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities\nSome creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.\n\nSenses\nThe Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.\n\nBlindsight\nA monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.   Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.  If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.\n\nDarkvision\nA monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.\n\nArmor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies\nAssume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment. For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither. See the\nPlayer’s Handbook for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.\n\nTremorsense\nA monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many\nburrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.\n\nTruesight\nA monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.\n\nLanguages\nThe languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A “-” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.\n\nTelepathy\nTelepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.\nA telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.\nA creature within the area of an antimagic fieldor in any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic messages.\n\nChallenge\nA monster’s\nchallenge rating tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.  Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.  Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.\n\nExperience Points\nThe number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.  Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.\n\nExperience Points by Challenge Rating\nChallenge  XP       Challenge  XP       \n0          0 or 10  14         11,500   \n1/8        25       15         13,000   \n1/4        50       16         15,000   \n1/2        100      17         18,000   \n1          200      18         20,000   \n2          450      19         22,000   \n3          700      20         25,000   \n4          1,100    21         33,000   \n5          1,800    22         41,000   \n6          2,300    23         50,000   \n7          2,900    24         62,000   \n8          3,900    25         75,000   \n9          5,000    26         90,000   \n10         5,900    27         105,000  \n11         7,200    28         120,000  \n12         8,400    29         135,000  \n13         10,000   30         155,000  \n\n\nSpecial Traits\nSpecial traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.\n\nInnate Spellcasting\nA monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.\nAn innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the\nlevitatespell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.\nA monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells. If a monster’s innate spells don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.\n\nSpellcasting\nA monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as\nexplained in the\nPlayer’s Handbook). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.\nThe monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when at tuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.\nA monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level\nlightning boltspell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.\nYou can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.\n\nPsionics\nA monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.\n\nActions\nWhen a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the Player’s Handbook.\n\nMelee and Ranged Attacks\nThe most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the Player’s Handbook.\nCreature vs. Target. The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.\nHit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “Hit” notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.\nMiss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the “Miss:” notation.\n\nMultiattack\nA creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.\n\nAmmunition\nA monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.\n\nReactions\nIf a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.\n\nLimited Usage\nSome special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.\nX/Day.The notation “X/Day” means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.\nRecharge X-Y.The notation “Recharge X-Y” means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.\nFor example, “Recharge 5-6” means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.\nRecharge after a Short or Long Rest.This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.\n\nGrapple Rules for Monsters\nMany monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.\nA creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster’s stat block. If no\nescape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster’s Strength (Athletics) modifier.\n\nEquipment\nA stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.\nYou can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.  If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.\n\nLegendary Creatures\nA legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.  If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.\n\nLegendary Actions\nA legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions-called legendary actions-outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.\n\nA Legendary Creature’s Lair\nA legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.\n\nLair Actions\nIf a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.\n\nRegional Effects\nThe mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.\n"], "response": "Artifacts are non-traditional magic items that are unique and often have complex, powerful abilities. They are typically created by ancient beings, such as dragons, demigods, or other legendary creatures, and are often tied to the lore of the world. Artifacts are not bound by the usual rules of magic item rarity or slot, and their effects can be unpredictable or dangerous. They often come with a history, a curse, or a unique ability that makes them highly sought after but also risky to possess.\n\nThe **Orb of Dragonkind** is an example of an artifact. It is a powerful item that allows the user to communicate with dragons or even control them. Its use is highly significant and can drastically influence the balance of power in a campaign. Because artifacts are so potent, they are rarely found in the hands of ordinary adventurers and are often the focus of major plotlines or conflicts.", "reference": "Artifacts are powerful magic items that often require attunement.

{"user_input": "Hey, i need to know about Size in the game, how it works, what are the categories, how big each one is, give me examples of monsters that fit each size category, and how it affects the space a creature controls in combat, can you explain all that?", "reference_contexts": ["Sentient Magic Items\nSome magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.  Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.  Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.\n\nCreating Sentient Magic Items\nWhen you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.\n\nAbilities\nA sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.\n\nCommunication\nA sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.\nd100   Communication                                                                                                                                                          \n01-60  The item communicates by transmitting emotion  to the creature carrying or wielding it.                                                                                \n61-90  The item can speak, read, and understand one  or more languages.                                                                                                       \n91-00  The item can speak, read, and understand one  or more languages. In addition, the item can  communicate telepathically with any character  that carries or wields it.  \n\n\nSenses\nWith sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table.\nd4  Senses                                      \n1   Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.   \n2   Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet    \n3   Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet.  \n4   Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.     \n\n\nAlignment\nA sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table.\nd100     Alignment        d100     Alignment        \n01 - 15  Lawful good      74 - 85  Chaotic neutral  \n16 - 35  Neutral good     86 - 89  Lawful evil      \n36 - 50  Chaotic good     90 - 96  Neutral evil     \n51 - 63  Lawful  neutral  97 - 00  Chaotic evil     \n64 - 73  Neutral          \n\n\nSpecial Purpose\nYou can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You\ncan pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.\nd10  Purpose                                                                                                                                   \n1    Aligned:  The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a  diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is  never neutral.)              \n2    Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of  a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls,  or wizards.            \n3    Pro tector:  The item seeks to defend a particular race  or kind of creature, such as elves or druids.                                    \n4    Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or  destroy the servants of a particular deity.                                               \n5    Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and  interests o f a particular deity.                                                     \n6    Destroyer: The item craves destruction and goads its  user to fight arbitrarily.                                                          \n7    Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the greatest  magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a  famous or notorious figure.  \n8    Lore  Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is  determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or  unravel a cryptic prophecy.             \n9    Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its  wielder have key roles to play in future events.                                   \n10   Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and wants  to understand why it was created.                                                   \n\n\nConflict\nA sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:\n•The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.\n•The item demands that its wielder dispose ofanything the item finds repugnant.\n•The item demands that its wielder pursue theitem’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.\n•The item demands to be given to someone else.If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’swishes, the item can do any or all of the following:\n•Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.\n•Suppress one or more of its activated properties.\n•Attempt to take control of its wielder.If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn.\n\nArtifacts\n\nOrb of Dragonkind\nWondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)\nAges past,elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five\nOrbs of Dragonkind\n(or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow\nsome measure of control over dragons.\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma\ncheck. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts\nsuggestionon you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the\nworld, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\nRandom Properties. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:\n•2 minor beneficial properties\n•1 minor detrimental property\n•1 major detrimental property\nSpells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18)from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges),or scrying (3 charges).You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.\nCall Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.\nDestroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.\n\n\nMonsters\nA monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its\nstat block, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.\n\nSize\nA monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the Player’s Handbook for more information on creature size and space.\n\nSize Categories\nSize        Space                   Examples             \nTiny        2½ by 2½ ft.            Imp, sprite          \nSmall       5 by 5 ft.              Giant rat, goblin    \nMedium      5 by 5 ft.              Orc, werewolf        \nLarge       10 by 10 ft.            Hippogriff, ogre     \nHuge        15 by 15 ft.            Fire giant, treant   \nGargantuan  20 by 20 ft. or larger  Kraken, purple worm  \n\n\nModifying Creatures\nDespite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a\nvariant or\ntemplate, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.\n\nType\nA monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.  The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.\nAberrations are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.\nBeasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.\nCelestialsare creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.\nConstructsare made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.\nDragonsare large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.\nElementals are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers and invisible stalkers.\nFeyare magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.\nFiendsare creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.\nGiants tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.\nHumanoids are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.\nMonstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense-frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.\nOozes are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.\nPlants in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.\nUndead are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.\n\nTags\nA monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.\n\nAlignment\nA monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack\ncharacters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the\nPlayer’s Handbookfor descriptions of the different alignments.\nThe alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change\na monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.\nSome creatures can have\nany alignment. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.\nMany creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are\nunaligned, which means they don’t have an alignment.\n\nArmor Class\nA monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.\n\nHit Points\nA monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the\nPlayer’s Handbook.\nA monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).\nA monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.\n\nHit Dice by Size\nMonster Size  Hit Die  Average HP per Die  \nTiny          d4       2½                  \nSmall         d6       3½                  \nMedium        d8       4½                  \nLarge         d10      5½                  \nHuge          d12      6½                  \nGargantuan    d20      10½                 \n\nA monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).\n\nSpeed\nA monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the Player’s Handbook.  All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.  Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.\n\nBurrow\nA monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.\n\nClimb\nA monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.\n\nFly\nA monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to\nhover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the Player’s Handbook). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.\n\nSwim\nA monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.\n\nAbility Scores\nEvery monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used in play, see the\nPlayer’s Handbook.\n\nSaving Throws\nThe Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.\nA saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).\n\nProficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating\nChallenge  Proficiency  Bonus  Challenge  Proficiency  Bonus  \n0          +2                  14         +5                  \n1/8        +2                  15         +5                  \n1/4        +2                  16         +5                  \n1/2        +2                  17         +6                  \n1          +2                  18         +6                  \n2          +2                  19         +6                  \n3          +2                  20         +6                  \n4          +2                  21         +7                  \n5          +3                  22         +7                  \n6          +3                  23         +7                  \n7          +3                  24         +7                  \n8          +3                  25         +8                  \n9          +4                  26         +8                  \n10         +4                  27         +8                  \n11         +4                  28         +8                  \n12         +4                  29         +9                  \n13         +5                  30         +9                  \n\n\nSkills\nThe Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\nA skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a\nmonster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.\n\nVulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities\nSome creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.\n\nSenses\nThe Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.\n\nBlindsight\nA monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.   Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.  If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.\n\nDarkvision\nA monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.\n\nArmor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies\nAssume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment. For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither. See the\nPlayer’s Handbook for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.\n\nTremorsense\nA monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many\nburrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.\n\nTruesight\nA monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.\n\nLanguages\nThe languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A “-” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.\n\nTelepathy\nTelepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.\nA telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.\nA creature within the area of an antimagic fieldor in any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic messages.\n\nChallenge\nA monster’s\nchallenge rating tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.  Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.  Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.\n\nExperience Points\nThe number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.  Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.\n\nExperience Points by Challenge Rating\nChallenge  XP       Challenge  XP       \n0          0 or 10  14         11,500   \n1/8        25       15         13,000   \n1/4        50       16         15,000   \n1/2        100      17         18,000   \n1          200      18         20,000   \n2          450      19         22,000   \n3          700      20         25,000   \n4          1,100    21         33,000   \n5          1,800    22         41,000   \n6          2,300    23         50,000   \n7          2,900    24         62,000   \n8          3,900    25         75,000   \n9          5,000    26         90,000   \n10         5,900    27         105,000  \n11         7,200    28         120,000  \n12         8,400    29         135,000  \n13         10,000   30         155,000  \n\n\nSpecial Traits\nSpecial traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.\n\nInnate Spellcasting\nA monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.\nAn innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the\nlevitatespell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.\nA monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells. If a monster’s innate spells don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.\n\nSpellcasting\nA monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as\nexplained in the\nPlayer’s Handbook). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.\nThe monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when at tuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.\nA monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level\nlightning boltspell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.\nYou can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.\n\nPsionics\nA monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.\n\nActions\nWhen a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the Player’s Handbook.\n\nMelee and Ranged Attacks\nThe most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the Player’s Handbook.\nCreature vs. Target. The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.\nHit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “Hit” notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.\nMiss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the “Miss:” notation.\n\nMultiattack\nA creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.\n\nAmmunition\nA monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.\n\nReactions\nIf a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.\n\nLimited Usage\nSome special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.\nX/Day.The notation “X/Day” means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.\nRecharge X-Y.The notation “Recharge X-Y” means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.\nFor example, “Recharge 5-6” means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.\nRecharge after a Short or Long Rest.This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.\n\nGrapple Rules for Monsters\nMany monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.\nA creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster’s stat block. If no\nescape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster’s Strength (Athletics) modifier.\n\nEquipment\nA stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.\nYou can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.  If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.\n\nLegendary Creatures\nA legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.  If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.\n\nLegendary Actions\nA legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions-called legendary actions-outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.\n\nA Legendary Creature’s Lair\nA legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.\n\nLair Actions\nIf a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.\n\nRegional Effects\nThe mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.\n"], "response": "**Size Categories in Dungeons & Dragons:**\n\n1. **Tiny (2.5 feet of space, 2.5-foot opening, 0-foot reach):**  \n   - **Description:** Tiny creatures occupy 2.5 feet of space and can fit through a 2.5-foot opening. They cannot attack with a reach greater than 0 feet.  \n   - **Examples:** Rat, Spider, Pixie.  \n   - **Combat Space:** Tiny creatures take up minimal space, allowing them to maneuver freely in tight spaces. Their limited reach means they must close in to attack, often relying on spells or projectiles.  \n\n2. **Small (5 feet of space, 5-foot opening, 5-foot reach):**  \n   - **Description:** Small creatures occupy 5 feet of space and can fit through a 5-foot opening. They can attack with a reach of 5 feet.  \n   - **Examples:** Gnome (race), Halfling (race), Lizard.  \n   - **Combat Space:** Small creatures occupy slightly more space than Tiny creatures. Their 5-foot reach allows them to attack without closing in, though they still face challenges against Larger foes.  \n\n3. **Medium (5 feet of space, 5-foot opening, 5-foot reach):**  \n   - **Description:** Medium creatures occupy 5 feet of space and can fit through a 5-foot opening. They can attack with a reach of 5 feet.  \n   - **Examples:** Goblin, Hobgoblin, Human.  \n   - **Combat Space:** Most humanoid monsters and player characters are Medium. They occupy standard space and have standard reach, making them versatile in combat.  \n\n4. **Large (10 feet of space, 10-foot opening, 10-foot reach):**  \n   - **Description:** Large creatures occupy 10 feet of space and can fit through a 10-foot opening. They can attack with a reach of 10 feet.  \n   - **Examples:** Giant, Minotaur, Centaur.  \n   - **Combat Space:** Large creatures occupy more space than Medium, making them harder to maneuver around. Their 10-foot reach allows them to strike enemies at a distance.  \n\n5. **Huge (15 feet of space, 15-foot opening, 15-foot reach):**  \n   - **Description:** Huge creatures occupy 15 feet of space and can fit through a 15-foot opening. They can attack with a reach of 15 feet.  \n   - **Examples:** Dragon, Tiamat.  \n   - **Combat Space:** Huge creatures occupy significant space, often blocking movement and terrain. Their long reach lets them attack from a distance, forcing enemies to close in.  \n\n6. **Gargantuan (20 feet of space, 20-foot opening, 20-foot reach):**  \n   - **Description:** Gargantuan creatures occupy 20 feet of space and can fit through a 20-foot opening. They can attack with a reach of 20 feet.  \n   - **Examples:** Kraken, Tiamat (in some forms), Colossus.  \n   - **Combat Space:** Gargantuan creatures dominate the battlefield, occupying vast areas and making it difficult for smaller creatures to attack effectively. Their immense reach allows them to strike from an extraordinary distance.  \n\n**Impact of Size on Combat:**  \n- **Space Control:** Larger creatures occupy more space, limiting the movement of smaller creatures. This can create bottlenecks or force enemies to take detours.  \n- **Reach and Positioning:** Larger creatures have greater reach, allowing them to strike enemies at a distance. Smaller creatures may need to close in to attack, making them vulnerable to area effects or multi-target attacks.  \n- **Tactical Advantages:** Creatures of different sizes can exploit their size differences. For example, a Large creature can block a Small creature’s path, while a Gargantuan creature can crush smaller foes with its sheer presence.  \n\n**Note:** While monsters of all sizes exist, Medium and Large are the most common, with Tiny and Gargantuan being rarer. Size also affects other mechanics, such as carrying capacity, movement speed, and the effectiveness of certain spells or abilities.", "reference": "Size refers to the categories Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, and Gargantuan.

{"user_input": "How do sentient magic items function as NPCs under GM control?", "reference_contexts": ["Sentient Magic Items Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side. Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient. Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally.

Here’s how they function as NPCs:\n\n1. **Personality and Behavior**: Sentient items have distinct personalities (e.g., prideful, paranoid, or loyal) and act in ways that align with their goals, much like NPCs. They can speak, think, and interact with the party, often with their own agendas.\n\n2. **Alignment and Motivations**: The GM determines the item’s alignment and how its goals might conflict with or support the party’s mission. For example, a sword seeking freedom might aid the party if it believes the party can help it escape its current wielder.\n\n3. **Interactions**: The GM controls the item’s dialogue and actions, using the *Speak with Magic Item* or *Identify* spells as needed to reveal its nature. The item might offer help, demand favors, or create complications based on its desires.\n\n4. **Abilities and Roleplay**: Sentient items use their magical abilities as described in their stat blocks, but the GM interprets how these abilities manifest in the narrative (e.g., a sentient shield might shield a party member during a critical moment, but only if it deems the action \"noble\").\n\n5. **Conflict and Complications**: The item’s goals might create challenges for the party, such as requiring the party to complete a quest for the item or face its wrath if its desires are ignored. This adds roleplay depth and potential plot hooks.\n\n6. **Balance**: The GM ensures the item’s sentience doesn’t overshadow the party’s agency. While the item may have its own agenda, the GM adjusts its influence to maintain a fair and engaging campaign.\n\nIn essence, sentient magic items are NPCs with unique personalities and goals, and their interactions with the party are shaped by the GM’s narrative choices and the item’s inherent traits.", "reference": "Sentient magic items act as NPCs under the GM’s control.

{"user_input": "What is a sentient item's Special purpose?", "reference_contexts": ["Creating Sentient Magic Items When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here. Abilities A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest. Communication A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table. d100 Communication 01-60 The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it. 61-90 The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. 91-00 The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it. Senses With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table. d4 Senses 1 Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet. 2 Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet 3 Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet. 4 Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet. Alignment A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table. d100 Alignment d100 Alignment 01 - 15 Lawful good 74 - 85 Chaotic neutral 16 - 35 Neutral good 86 - 89 Lawful evil 36 - 50 Chaotic good 90 - 96 Neutral evil 51 - 63 Lawful neutral 97 - 00 Chaotic evil 64 - 73 Neutral Special Purpose You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following table. d10 Purpose 1 Aligned: The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is never neutral.) 2 Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or wizards. 3 Pro tector: The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind of creature, such as elves or druids. 4 Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the servants of a particular deity. 5 Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and interests o f a particular deity. 6 Destroyer: The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily. 7 Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious figure. 8 Lore Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy. 9 Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events. 10 Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created. Conflict A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands: •The item insists on being carried or worn at all times. •The item demands that its wielder dispose ofanything the item finds repugnant. •The item demands that its wielder pursue theitem’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals. •The item demands to be given to someone else.If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’swishes, the item can do any or all of the following: •Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it. •Suppress one or more of its activated properties. •Attempt to take control of its wielder.If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn."], "response": "A **sentient item** has a **Special purpose** that defines its behavior and goals. This purpose is an inherent part of its nature, often tied to the intent of its creator or the circumstances of its creation.

{"user_input": "tell me how fear spell works and what it do in story world, and how it can be used for drama?", "reference_contexts": ["The Schools of Magic Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity. The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools. Abjurationspells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence. Conjurationspells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing. Divinationspells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places. Enchantmentspells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet. Evocationspells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds. Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature. Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life. Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently. Transmutation spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury. Combining Magical Effects The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect-such as the highest bonus-from those castings applies while their durations overlap. For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is frightened of the caster for the duration. The frightened creature must move away from the caster if it can, and it can't take reactions. On a successful save, the target is immune to the spell for the next 24 hours.\n\nIn the story world, *Fear* can be used to create tension and fear in opponents. It can be a tool for a character to dominate a situation by instilling terror in enemies, which can lead to dramatic moments where characters are forced to confront their fears or make difficult choices. The spell can also be used to protect allies by preventing enemies from reacting or advancing, allowing the party to gain the upper hand.\n\nFor drama, *Fear* can be used in various situations. For example, a character might use it to save a friend from a dangerous situation by making an enemy flee. Alternatively, it could be used to force a confrontation where the enemy is terrified, leading to a tense negotiation or a moral dilemma. The spell can also be a turning point in a battle, where the fear it instills leads to a critical moment that changes the course of the story. The emotional impact of the spell can be amplified by the way it affects the target, making it a powerful tool for storytelling and character development.", "reference": "Fear is a spell mentioned in the list of spells.

The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze. The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds). When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately.

You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates. Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event. You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered.

It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spell’s light. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction. At Higher Levels.

You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect. Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement. This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain.

Moonbeam 2nd-level evocation Casting Time:1 action Range:120 feet Components:V, S, M (several seeds of any moon seed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar) Duration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteA silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spell’s light. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd. Move Earth 6th-level transmutation Casting Time:1 action Range:120 feet Components:V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils-clay, loam, and sand) Duration:Concentration, up to 2 hoursChoose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect. Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement. This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse. Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it. Nondetection 3rd-level abjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25 gp sprinkled over the target, which the spell consumes) Duration: 8 hours For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can’t be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. Pass without Trace 2nd-level abjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage. Passwall 5th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range:30 feet Components:V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds) Duration:1 hourA passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You"], "response": "The *memorize* spell is a powerful tool for a narrator to explore themes of memory, identity, and manipulation. Its mechanical effect—erasing a specific memory—can be used to create tension, moral dilemmas, or even plot twists. Here’s how you can integrate it into your storytelling while staying within the rules and enhancing the narrative:\n\n### 1. **Using *Memorize* for Narrative Depth**\n   - **Mechanical Soundness**: The spell’s effect is limited to erasing a specific memory, which avoids overreach. This aligns with the game’s balance, as it doesn’t grant the caster the ability to rewrite reality or create new memories. The spell is a tool for subtlety, not omnipotence.\n   - **Narrative Richness**: Use the spell to explore themes like guilt, trauma, or the consequences of memory loss. For example, a character might use *memorize* to erase a traumatic event, but the emotional weight of the memory could linger, creating internal conflict.\n\n### 2. **The GM’s Perspective on Nonsensical Memories**\n   - A nonsensical memory (e.g., a random, absurd event) might be deemed too trivial to affect a creature meaningfully. The GM could rule that such memories are either **unaffected by the spell** or **only partially erased**, leaving the creature with fragmented, incoherent recollections. This adds flavor by avoiding overpowered or illogical effects. For example, a creature might forget a nonsensical memory but still feel an inexplicable unease, hinting at deeper, unresolved issues.\n\n### 3. **Incorporating *Memorize* into Campaign Lore**\n   - **Cultural Context**: In your world, memory could be a currency or a weapon. A society might use *memorize* to erase past crimes, while a cult could use it to brainwash followers. This ties the spell to the lore and creates opportunities for conflict.\n   - **Magic Items**: A relic that stores memories or a staff that channels *memorize* could be central to your story. For example, a cursed artifact might force victims to forget their loved ones, creating emotional stakes.\n\n### 4. **Permanently Eliminating or Creating Memories**\n   - **Eliminating Memories**: The spell does not erase memories permanently; it only removes a specific memory. However, a GM could rule that repeated use of *memorize* on the same memory (e.g., through a ritual or artifact) could lead to permanent erasure. This could be used for tragic or moral consequences, such as a character losing their sense of self.\n   - **Creating New Memories**: *Memorize* does not create new memories, but a DM could use narrative tools (e.g., a *dream* spell or a cursed object) to implant false memories. This could create intrigue, such as a character discovering their entire life is a fabrication.\n\n### 5. **Balancing Mechanics and Lore**\n   - **Limitations**: Emphasize that *memorize* is a tool for subtlety, not a solution to every problem. Its effectiveness depends on the GM’s rulings and the world’s logic. For example, a memory tied to a deity’s will might be unerasable, adding depth.\n   - **Flavor Enhancements**: Use the spell to explore the consequences of memory loss. A character might forget a friend but still feel their presence, or a monster might lose its fear of a hero but retain a primal instinct to flee.\n\n### 6. **Creative Applications**\n   - **Political Intrigue**: A ruler might use *memorize* to erase dissent, while rebels could use it to protect secrets.\n   - **Character Development**: A character’s use of *memorize* could reflect their growth—e.g., from a reckless hero who erases guilt to a wise leader who learns to live with the past.\n   - **World-Building**: In a setting where memory is sacred (e.g., a society of oracles), erasing a memory might be a grave offense, leading to moral dilemmas.\n\nBy weaving *memorize* into your campaign’s themes and lore, you can create a rich, emotionally resonant story that respects the spell’s mechanics while pushing the narrative to new depths.", "reference": "According to the spell description, the caster can permanently eliminate all memory of an event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity, change the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event. The spell requires the caster to speak to the target and the target must understand the language for the memory changes to take root. The target is charmed, incapacitated, and unaware of surroundings, but can still hear. The spell ends if the target takes damage or is targeted by another spell, and if the spell ends before the caster finishes describing the memory changes, the target’s memory is not altered. If the spell ends after the description, the modified memories take hold. A modified memory does not necessarily affect the creature’s behavior, especially if it contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical or nonsensical memory, such as one that says the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed and may be deemed too nonsensical by the GM to affect the creature significantly. A remove curse or greater restoration spell restores the creature’s true memory. At higher levels, the spell can alter memories of events up to 7 days (6th level), 30 days (7th level), 1 year (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).", "answer_relevancy": 0.6091507683425751, "semantic_similarity": 0.413481512972149, "bleu_score": 0.05744410453919958, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.1391509433962264, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.09470304975922954, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.26222222222222225}

You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.  Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.  You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.\n\nPlant Growth\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action or 8 hours\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.  If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.  You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area from being affected.  If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.\n\nPoison Spray\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:10 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.\nThis spell's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).\n\nPolymorph\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 hourThis spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n\nPower Word Kill\n9th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly.

Otherwise, the spell has no effect.\n\nPower Word Stun\n8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.  The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.\n\nPrayer of Healing\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\n\nPrestidigitation\nTransmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Up to 1 hour This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:\n•You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind,faint musical notes, or an odd odor.\n•You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.\n•You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.\n•You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.\n•You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.\n•You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\n\nPrismatic Spray\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self (60-foot cone)\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousEight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.\n1.Red.The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n2.Orange.The target takes 10d6 acid damage ona failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n3.Yellow.The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n4.Green.The target takes 10d6 poison damage ona failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n5.Blue.The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n6.Indigo.On a failed save, the target is restrained.It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.\n7.Violet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. Itmust then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)\n8.Special. The target is struck by two rays. Rolltwice more, rerolling any 8.\n\nPrismatic Wall\n9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick-centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.  The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.  The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.  The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.\n1.Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\n2.Orange.The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer\nis destroyed by a strong wind.\n3.Yellow.The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n4.Green.The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A\npasswallspell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\n5.Blue.The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n6.Indigo.On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.\nIf it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\nWhile this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a\ndaylightspell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\n7.Violet.On a failed save, the creature is blinded.It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a\ndispel magicspell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.\n\nPrivate Sanctum\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time:10 minutes\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)\nDuration:24 hours\nYou make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.  When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:\n•Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge ofthe warded area.\n•The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision)through it.\n•Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.\n•Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.\n•Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.\n•Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.Casting this spell on the same spot every day for ayear makes this effect permanent.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.\n\nProduce Flame\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.  You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.  This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\n\nProgrammed Illusion\n6th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration:Until dispelledYou create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.\nWhen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.\nThe triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.\n\nProject Image\n7th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:500 miles\nComponents:V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 dayYou create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.\nYou can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.  You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.  Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.\n\nProtection from Energy\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\n\nProtection from Evil and Good\n1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Concentration up to 10 minutes Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.  The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.\n\nProtection from Poison\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:1 hourYou touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.\nFor the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.\n\nPurify Food and Drink\n1st-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:10 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousAll nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease.\n\nRaise Dead\n5th-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 hour\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:InstantaneousYou return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.\nThis spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead creature to life.\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival-its head, for instance-the spell automatically fails.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.\n"], "response": "The *prestidigitation* spell is a versatile tool in Dungeons & Dragons that allows a caster to perform minor magical effects, such as creating small objects, changing the color of an object, or producing sensory effects like sounds, smells, or temperatures.

You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.  Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.  You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.\n\nPlant Growth\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action or 8 hours\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.  If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.  You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area from being affected.  If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.\n\nPoison Spray\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:10 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm.

An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form.

On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.\n\nPrayer of Healing\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\n\nPrestidigitation\nTransmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Up to 1 hour This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:\n•You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind,faint musical notes, or an odd odor.\n•You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.\n•You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.\n•You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.\n•You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.\n•You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\n\nPrismatic Spray\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self (60-foot cone)\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousEight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.\n1.Red.The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n2.Orange.The target takes 10d6 acid damage ona failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n3.Yellow.The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n4.Green.The target takes 10d6 poison damage ona failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n5.Blue.The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n6.Indigo.On a failed save, the target is restrained.It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.\n7.Violet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. Itmust then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)\n8.Special. The target is struck by two rays. Rolltwice more, rerolling any 8.\n\nPrismatic Wall\n9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick-centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.  The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.  The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.  The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.\n1.Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\n2.Orange.The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer\nis destroyed by a strong wind.\n3.Yellow.The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n4.Green.The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A\npasswallspell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\n5.Blue.The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n6.Indigo.On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.\nIf it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\nWhile this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a\ndaylightspell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\n7.Violet.On a failed save, the creature is blinded.It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a\ndispel magicspell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.\n\nPrivate Sanctum\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time:10 minutes\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)\nDuration:24 hours\nYou make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.  When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:\n•Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge ofthe warded area.\n•The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision)through it.\n•Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.\n•Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.\n•Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.\n•Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.Casting this spell on the same spot every day for ayear makes this effect permanent.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.\n\nProduce Flame\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.  You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.  This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\n\nProgrammed Illusion\n6th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration:Until dispelledYou create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.\nWhen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.\nThe triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.\n\nProject Image\n7th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:500 miles\nComponents:V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 dayYou create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.\nYou can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.  You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.  Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.\n\nProtection from Energy\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\n\nProtection from Evil and Good\n1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Concentration up to 10 minutes Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.  The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.\n\nProtection from Poison\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:1 hourYou touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.\nFor the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.\n\nPurify Food and Drink\n1st-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:10 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousAll nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease.\n\nRaise Dead\n5th-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 hour\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:InstantaneousYou return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.\nThis spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead creature to life.\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival-its head, for instance-the spell automatically fails.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.\n"], "response": "To use *Raise Dead*, you must expend a 7th-level spell slot and use the required materials: a vial of blood from the dead creature and a diamond worth at least 500 gp.

An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration. Nothing-not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects-can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it. The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures. A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points. This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life. This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts. Comingback from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

All creatures and objects that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall. If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration. At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down. Revivify 3rd-level necromancy Casting Time:1 action Range:Touch Components: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration: Instantaneous You touch a creature that has died within the last minute.

One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends. The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space. Attacks and spells can’t cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.

On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist. Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t move.

You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica. After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell’s effect ends.

Seeming 5th-level illusion Casting Time:1 action Range:30 feet Components:V, S Duration:8 hoursThis spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell. The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells. If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older. You can set a condition for the spell to end early.

The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form. You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak. When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state. During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.

Simulacrum 7th-level illusion Casting Time: 12 hours Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature’s body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell) Duration: Until dispelled You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature’s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates. The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots. If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly. If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed. Sleep 1st-level enchantment Casting Time: 1 action Range: 90 feet Components: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket) Duration:1 minuteThis spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.

The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days. Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events. Speak with Plants 3rd-level transmutation Casting Time:1 action Range:Self (30-foot radius) Components:V, S Duration:10 minutesYou imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances. You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example. Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it. Spirit Guardians 3rd-level conjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (15-foot radius) Components: V, S, M (a holy symbol) Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.

When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon can take whatever form you choose.

The spell requires **verbal and somatic components** and has a **range of 60 feet**. Its **duration is concentration, up to 1 minute**, meaning the spell ends if the caster loses concentration, such as by taking damage or being incapacitated.\n\n### **Key Effects and Mechanics:**\n- **Climbing Ability:** The spell grants the target the ability to move **up to 20 feet per round** while climbing, regardless of the surface’s texture or slope. The target does not need to use a hand to hold on to the surface.\n- **Surface Requirements:** The surface must be **solid and capable of supporting the target’s weight**. It cannot be slippery or too smooth (e.g., ice or glass). If the surface is too slick, the spell fails.\n- **Limitations:**\n  - The target **cannot move more than 20 feet per round** while climbing.\n  - The spell does **not allow the target to walk on water or other liquids**.\n  - The spell **does not grant the ability to climb ceilings or walls** that are too smooth or lack any surface to brace against (e.g., a perfectly smooth wall).\n  - The spell **does not grant the ability to climb without a surface to brace against** (e.g., a sheer cliff face with no holds).\n  - If the **target is too large or heavy** (e.g., a vehicle or a large creature), the spell may not function.\n\n### **Important Rules for Beginners:**\n- **Concentration:** The spell ends if the caster is **disrupted** (e.g., takes damage, is incapacitated, or is otherwise unable to maintain concentration).\n- **Surface Type:** Beginners should **check the surface** before casting the spell. If the surface is too slippery or lacks texture, the spell will not work.\n- **Size and Weight:** The spell is **not effective for very large or heavy targets**. A DM may rule that the spell fails if the target’s size or weight makes climbing impossible.\n- **Combat Use:** The spell is **particularly useful in combat** for gaining advantageous positions (e.g., climbing walls to flank enemies or escape from combat).\n- **Exploration:** It allows **creatures to navigate difficult terrain** (e.g., climbing walls, exploring vertical spaces, or rescuing allies stuck on a wall).\n\n### **Summary:**\nSpider Climb is a versatile spell that enhances mobility, but it has specific limitations.

Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.

While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able. Hopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects. Insanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw.

You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air. On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest. Object.You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. On Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to. Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area.You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. Mishap.The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time). Teleportation Circle 5th-level conjuration Casting Time:1 minute Range:10 feet Components:V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration:1 roundAs you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence-a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute. You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.", "<2-hop>\n\nspell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell. Symbol 7th-level abjuration Casting Time:1 minute Range:Touch Components:V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration:Until dispelled or triggeredWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. Death.Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. Discord. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Fear. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able. Hopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects. Insanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic. Pain. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save. Sleep. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. Stunning. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save. Telekinesis 5th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell. Creature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air. On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest. Object.You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell. You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

Thus, the bonded group can still share information, coordinate their actions, and help each other escape or mitigate the glyph’s effects, all while the bond continues to function across the battlefield.

The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days. Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.

You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances. You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example. Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks. If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.

The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell’s effect resemble that weapon.

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration. An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted.

In contrast, the *Speak with Animals* spell allows communication with animals, which are mobile and can share information about nearby creatures, recent events, and terrain features. While both spells are useful for gathering environmental and creature-related information, *Speak with Animals* is generally more versatile for tracking moving targets or learning about recent developments, while *Speak with Plants* is better suited for understanding the static aspects of an environment.", "reference": "Speak with Plants is a 3rd‑level transmutation spell that, when cast, imbues all plants within a 30‑foot radius of the caster with limited sentience and animation.

Additionally, the spell allows the caster to turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth into ordinary terrain for the duration, or to turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain, thereby affecting movement.  Plants might also perform tasks on the caster’s behalf at the GM’s discretion, and the spell can cause plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.

You create one of the following magical effects within range:\n•Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.\n•You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.\n•You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1minute.\n•You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.\n•You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.\n•You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\n\nThunderwave\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cube)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.\n\nTime Stop\n9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V\nDuration:InstantaneousYou briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.\nThis spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet\nfrom the location where you cast it.\n\nTiny Hut\n3rd-level evocation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:Self (10-foot-radius hemisphere)\nComponents:V, S, M (a small crystal bead)\nDuration:8 hoursA 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.\nNine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.\nUntil the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.\n\nTongues\n3rd-level divination\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears.

For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.\n\nTree Stride\n5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you’re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.  You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.\n\nTrue Polymorph\n9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.\nThis spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\nAn unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.\n\nCreature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number\nof hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n\nObject into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s size and\nthe creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.\n\nCreature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.\n\nTrue Resurrection\n9th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.  This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.  The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature’s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.\n\nTrue Seeing\n6th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nTrue Strike\nDivination cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 round You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target’s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn’t ended.\n\nUnseen Servant\n1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.\nOnce on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.\nIf you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.\n\nVampiric Touch\n3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteThe touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nVicious Mockery\nEnchantment cantrip\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V\nDuration: Instantaneous You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.  This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).\n\nWall of Fire\n4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.  When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.  One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.\n\nWall of Force\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).\nNothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by\ndispel magic.A disintegratespell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.\n\nWall of Ice\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nThe wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.\n\nWall of Stone\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small block of granite)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.  If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.  The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.  If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.  The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.  If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.\n\nWall of Thorns\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of thorns)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nA creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.\n\nWarding Bond\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.\nThe spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.\n\nWater Breathing\n3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)\nDuration:24 hoursThis spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.\n\nWater Walk\n3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of cork)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface-such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava-as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.  If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.\n\nWeb\n2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.  If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.  Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.  A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.  The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.\n\nWeird\n9th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to one minute Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.\n\nWind Walk\n6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (fire and holy water)\nDuration:8 hoursYou and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.\nIf a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.\n\nWind Wall\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteA wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.\n\nWish\n9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.  The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.  Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n•You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no morethan 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n•You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n•You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n•You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.\n•You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a\nwishspell could undo an opponent’s successful save, afoe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to usethe reroll or the original roll.You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast\nwishever again if you suffer this stress.\n\nWord of Recall\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:5 feet\nComponents:V\nDuration:InstantaneousYou and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.\nYou must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn’t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.\n\nZone of Truth\n2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:10 minutes\nYou create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.  An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.\n"], "response": "The **Warding Bond** spell is a 2nd-level evocation spell that creates a magical bond between the caster and a willing creature.

Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.\n\nTime Stop\n9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V\nDuration:InstantaneousYou briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.\nThis spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet\nfrom the location where you cast it.\n\nTiny Hut\n3rd-level evocation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:Self (10-foot-radius hemisphere)\nComponents:V, S, M (a small crystal bead)\nDuration:8 hoursA 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.\nNine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.\nUntil the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.\n\nTongues\n3rd-level divination\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears.

You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.\n\nTree Stride\n5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you’re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.  You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.\n\nTrue Polymorph\n9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.\nThis spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\nAn unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.\n\nCreature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number\nof hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n\nObject into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s size and\nthe creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.\n\nCreature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.\n\nTrue Resurrection\n9th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.  This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.  The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature’s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.\n\nTrue Seeing\n6th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nTrue Strike\nDivination cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 round You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target’s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn’t ended.\n\nUnseen Servant\n1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.\nOnce on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.\nIf you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.\n\nVampiric Touch\n3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteThe touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nVicious Mockery\nEnchantment cantrip\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V\nDuration: Instantaneous You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.  This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).\n\nWall of Fire\n4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.  When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.  One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.\n\nWall of Force\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).\nNothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by\ndispel magic.A disintegratespell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.\n\nWall of Ice\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nThe wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.\n\nWall of Stone\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small block of granite)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.  If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.  The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.  If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.  The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.  If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.\n\nWall of Thorns\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of thorns)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nA creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.\n\nWarding Bond\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.\nThe spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.\n\nWater Breathing\n3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)\nDuration:24 hoursThis spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.\n\nWater Walk\n3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of cork)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface-such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava-as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.  If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.\n\nWeb\n2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.  If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.  Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.  A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.  The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.\n\nWeird\n9th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to one minute Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.\n\nWind Walk\n6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (fire and holy water)\nDuration:8 hoursYou and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.\nIf a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.\n\nWind Wall\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteA wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.\n\nWish\n9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.  The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.  Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n•You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no morethan 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n•You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n•You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n•You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.\n•You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a\nwishspell could undo an opponent’s successful save, afoe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to usethe reroll or the original roll.You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast\nwishever again if you suffer this stress.\n\nWord of Recall\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:5 feet\nComponents:V\nDuration:InstantaneousYou and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.\nYou must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn’t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.\n\nZone of Truth\n2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:10 minutes\nYou create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.  An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.\n"], "response": "*Vampiric Touch* is a 1st-level necromancy spell that you can cast as a reaction when you are hit by an attack or targeted by a harmful spell, provided that the attack or spell would deal damage to you. The spell requires a touch. You deal 1d6 necrotic damage to the target, and you regain 1d6 + 1 hit point. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take the damage and be charmed by you (as per the *charm person* spell) for the duration. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it succeeds on three such saves, the spell ends. The spell has a casting time of 1 reaction, a range of 10 feet, and a duration of instantaneous. The components are somatic and material (a small, blackened human tooth).

Here’s a breakdown of how such transportation might work based on existing rules and creative interpretations:\n\n### 1. **Spells and Magic**\n   - **Entangle (Druid/Ranger Spell):** While *Entangle* primarily hinders movement by creating brambles, a creative use could involve using vines to pull or drag a target through a dense thicket or into a hidden passage. This would require the caster to maintain concentration and the target to be within range.\n   - **Plant Growth (Druid Spell):** This spell can create a dense wall of brambles or a thicket. A druid could theoretically use this to guide or move a creature through a created passage, though the spell’s primary intent is to block movement rather than transport.\n   - **Telekinesis (Wizard Spell):** While not plant-based, a wizard might combine *Telekinesis* with plant growth to manipulate vines or roots to move objects or creatures. This would require careful coordination of spells.\n\n### 2. **Class Features and Abilities**\n   - **Druid Magic (Shapechanger Feature):** A druid could use their *Shapechanger* ability (e.g., in *Circle of the Forest* or *Circle of Spores*) to transform into a plant and use its natural abilities to move through dense foliage or guide others through it.\n   - **Ranger’s Feral Senses:** A ranger with the *Feral Senses* feature might use their connection to nature to navigate or move through plant-covered terrain more effectively, though this doesn’t involve active transportation.\n\n### 3. **Creative Use of Plant Magic**\n   - **Vine Lifting/Transportation:** A druid or other plant-based spellcaster could use enchanted vines to lift or carry a target, similar to how *Telekinesis* works. This would require a homebrew or reflavored spell or ability, as no official spell explicitly allows this.\n   - **Root Networks:** A powerful druid or plant-based entity (e.g., a *treant*) might use an underground root network to \"teleport\" a target to another location by moving them through the roots, akin to a teleportation effect but through natural means.\n\n### 4. **House Rules or Custom Mechanics**\n   If the game master (GM) allows, plant-based transportation could be introduced as a unique ability or spell. For example:\n   - **Entangle + Teleport:** A druid could use *Entangle* to pull a target into a hidden bramble wall, which then acts as a teleportation conduit, moving the target to another location.\n   - **Bramble Bridge:** A druid might create a living bridge of brambles that can carry a creature across a gap, using *Plant Growth* or *Entangle* to form the structure.\n\n### Summary\nTransportation via plants in D&D is not a standard rule, but it can be achieved through creative use of spells like *Entangle* or *Plant Growth*, combined with class features or GM-approved mechanics.

This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. Magical Travel.Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trickspell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.

The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.

You choose one the following options for what appears: •Oneelemental of challenge rating 2 or lower •Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or lower •Four elementals of challenge rating 1/2 or lower"], "response": "The spell *Conjure Minor Elementals* (PHB, p. 237) allows you to summon 2 to 8 elementals (1 per spell slot: 2nd level = 2, 3rd = 3, 4th = 4, 5th = 5, 6th = 6, 7th = 7, 8th = 8), which must be one of the following elemental types: fire, water, air, or earth. The elementals are **controlled by you** for the duration of the spell, and they remain until the spell ends or you dismiss them (as a bonus action). If you lose concentration or the spell ends, the elementals return to their elemental plane.\n\n### Key Rules for *Conjure Minor Elementals*:\n1. **Summoning**: \n   - Choose 2 to 8 elementals (depending on the spell slot used).\n   - Each elemental is summoned individually, and their type is chosen when you cast the spell.\n   - They appear in unoccupied spaces of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you.\n\n2. **Elemental Behavior**:\n   - Elementals are **controlled by you** and follow your commands.\n   - They act on your turn and move as you direct them, but they do not have their own actions or reactions.\n   - If you dismiss them or the spell ends, they return to their elemental plane immediately.\n\n3. **Duration and Concentration**:\n   - The spell lasts for **1 hour** (concentration) or until you dismiss the elementals.\n   - If you lose concentration or the spell ends, the elementals return to their plane.\n\n4. **Elemental Abilities**:\n   - Each elemental has specific abilities based on its type (fire, water, air, or earth), as outlined in the *Player’s Handbook* (see the \"Elemental\" stat block).\n   - They do not have the *Incorporeal* or *Unnaturally Resilient* traits, unlike major elementals.\n\n5. **Limitations**:\n   - You cannot summon more than one elemental of the same type per spell.\n   - If an elemental is destroyed, it returns to its plane and cannot be summoned again during the same casting.\n   - The spell does not grant you any additional magical abilities beyond controlling the elementals.\n\n6. **Optional Rule (Optional Rule for Elementals, PHB, p. 237)**:\n   - If you choose to use the optional rule for elementals, they act with their own initiative and follow their own behaviors, but they still remain under your command. This adds complexity and roleplay opportunities.\n\n### Example:\n- **Spell Slot 2nd**: Summon 2 elementals (fire, water, air, or earth).\n- **Spell Slot 8th**: Summon 8 elementals (up to 2 of each type).\n\nThis spell is powerful for controlling elemental forces in battle or for environmental manipulation, but it requires careful management of concentration and spell slots.", "reference": "Conjure Minor Elementals is a 4th‑level conjuration spell.

Here's how the GM's role differs for each spell:\n\n### **Charm Person**\n- **Role**: The GM ensures that the spell's mechanics are followed as written. This includes determining the target's reaction, resolving the saving throw, and applying the charm effect. The GM must also ensure that the spell is used in a way that aligns with the narrative and does not violate the rules (e.g., preventing the caster from using the spell to manipulate the party or create unfair advantages).\n- **Statistics**: Since *Charm Person* does not summon creatures, the GM is not directly involved in determining statistics for summoned entities. However, the GM ensures that the spell's effects (e.g., the charmed creature's behavior) are consistent with the rules in the *Player's Handbook* (PHB) or other sourcebooks.\n\n### **Conjure Woodland Beings**\n- **Role**: The GM is responsible for applying the spell's effects, including summoning the correct number of creatures from the listed options (e.g., sprites, dryads, etc.). The GM must ensure that the summoned creatures have the correct statistics as described in the spell's description, which are detailed in the PHB or other D&D sourcebooks. This includes their armor class, hit points, attack bonuses, damage, and special abilities.\n- **Statistics**: The GM ensures that the summoned creatures' statistics are used appropriately during combat and other interactions. This involves checking that the creatures' abilities (e.g., *Fey Step*, *Invisibility*) are applied correctly and that their actions align with their listed statistics. The GM may also adjust the number of creatures summoned based on the spell's level and the caster's concentration, but the core statistics are derived directly from the spell's description.\n\n### **Key Considerations**\n- **Consistency**: The GM must ensure that the spell effects are applied consistently with the game's rules and the narrative. For example, in *Charm Person*, the GM ensures that the charmed creature does not act against the caster's interest, while in *Conjure Woodland Beings*, the GM ensures that summoned creatures behave as described.\n- **Balance**: The GM should avoid over- or under-powering the spells by adhering to the statistics and limitations provided in the rulebooks. For *Conjure Woodland Beings*, this includes limiting the number of creatures summoned and ensuring that their abilities are not exploited in ways that disrupt the game's balance.\n- **Narrative Integration**: Both spells should be integrated into the story in a way that enhances the game's immersion and challenges the players without being arbitrary or inconsistent.\n\nIn summary, the GM's role in both spells involves ensuring that the rules are followed, the statistics are applied correctly, and the effects are consistent with the game's narrative and balance. For *Charm Person*, this focuses on the charm effect and its limitations, while for *Conjure Woodland Beings*, it centers on summoning creatures with accurate statistics and managing their interactions within the game.", "reference": "The GM has the creatures’ statistics.", "answer_relevancy": 0.7994646084403486, "semantic_similarity": 0.4429479207085885, "bleu_score": 0.012090878038257867, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.019305019305019305, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.009765625, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.8333333333333334}
{"user_input": "What does the Mindfire disease do?", "reference_contexts": ["Contact Other Plane\n5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 minute You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish.

The GM answers each question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.\n\nContagion\n5th-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponent:V, S\nDuration:7 daysYour touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.\nAt the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.\nSince this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.\n\nBlinding Sickness.Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.\n\nFilth Fever.A raging fever sweeps through the creature’s body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.\n\nFlesh Rot.Thecreature’s flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.\n\nMindfire.The creature’s mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the\ncreature behaves as if under the effects of the confusion spell during combat.\nSeizure. The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.\nSlimy Doom. The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.\n\nContingency\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 10 days Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with water breathingmight stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.  The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.  The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.\n\nContinual Flame\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A\ncontinual flamecan be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.\n\nControl Water\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:300 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with\nit to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if\nthe water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the\nbase, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.  When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.  The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\n\nControl Weather\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self (5-mile radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.  When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.  When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.\n\nPrecipitation\nStage  Condition                                    \n1      Clear                                        \n2      Light clouds                                 \n3      Overcast or ground fog                       \n4      Rain, hail, or snow                          \n5      Torrential rain, driving  hail, or blizzard  \n\n\nTemperature\nStage  Condition        \n1      Unbearable heat  \n2      Hot              \n3      Warm             \n4      Cool             \n5      Cold             \n6      Arctic cold      \n\n\nWind\nStage  Condition      \n1      Calm           \n2      Moderate wind  \n3      Strong wind    \n4      Gale           \n5      Storm          \n\n\nCounterspell\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.\nAt\nHigher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.\n\nCreate Food and Water\n3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn’t go bad.\n\nCreate or Destroy Water\n1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of water if creating water or a few grains of sand if destroying it)\nDuration: Instantaneous You either create or destroy water.\nCreate Water. You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.\nDestroy Water. You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot cube within range.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.\n\nCreate Undead\n6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black onyx stone for each corpse)\nDuration: Instantaneous You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)  As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.  The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.\n\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell\nusing an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.\n\nCreation\n5th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create)\nDuration:SpecialYou pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of\na form and material that you have seen before.\nThe duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.\nMaterial               Duration    \nVegetable matter       1 day       \nStone or crystal       12 hours    \nPrecious  metals       1 hour      \nGems                   10 minutes  \nAdamantine or mithral  1 minute    \n\nUsing any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.\n\nCure Wounds\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Instantaneous\nA creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.\n\nDancing Lights\nEvocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.  As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.\n\nDarkness\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.  If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.  If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.\n\nDarkvision\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)\nDuration:8 hoursYou touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.\n\nDaylight\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:1 hourA 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.\nIf you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.\nIf any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.\n\nDeath Ward\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:8 hoursYou touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.\nThe first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.\nIf the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.\n\nDelayed Blast Fireball\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.  If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.  The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.\n\nDemiplane\n8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: 1 hour You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.  Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.\n\nDetect Evil and Good\n1st-level divination\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesFor the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\n\nDetect Magic\n1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutesFor the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\n\nDetect Poison and Disease\n1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S, M (a yew leaf)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesFor the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\n\nDetect Thoughts\n2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a copper piece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.  You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature-what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.  Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.  You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.  Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.\n"], "response": "Mindfire is a rare and dangerous magical disease in the Forgotten Realms, typically associated with the city of Waterdeep.

{"user_input": "What are the consequences of a failed save on Contact Other Plane?", "reference_contexts": ["Contact Other Plane\n5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 minute You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. A\ngreater restorationspell cast on you ends\nthis effect.\nOn a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.\n\nContagion\n5th-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponent:V, S\nDuration:7 daysYour touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.\nAt the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.\nSince this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.\n\nBlinding Sickness.Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.\n\nFilth Fever.A raging fever sweeps through the creature’s body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.\n\nFlesh Rot.Thecreature’s flesh decays.

The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.\nSlimy Doom. The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.\n\nContingency\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 10 days Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with water breathingmight stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.  The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.  The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.\n\nContinual Flame\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A\ncontinual flamecan be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.\n\nControl Water\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:300 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with\nit to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if\nthe water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the\nbase, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.  When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.  The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\n\nControl Weather\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self (5-mile radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.  When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.  When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.\n\nPrecipitation\nStage  Condition                                    \n1      Clear                                        \n2      Light clouds                                 \n3      Overcast or ground fog                       \n4      Rain, hail, or snow                          \n5      Torrential rain, driving  hail, or blizzard  \n\n\nTemperature\nStage  Condition        \n1      Unbearable heat  \n2      Hot              \n3      Warm             \n4      Cool             \n5      Cold             \n6      Arctic cold      \n\n\nWind\nStage  Condition      \n1      Calm           \n2      Moderate wind  \n3      Strong wind    \n4      Gale           \n5      Storm          \n\n\nCounterspell\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.\nAt\nHigher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.\n\nCreate Food and Water\n3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn’t go bad.\n\nCreate or Destroy Water\n1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of water if creating water or a few grains of sand if destroying it)\nDuration: Instantaneous You either create or destroy water.\nCreate Water. You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.\nDestroy Water. You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot cube within range.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.\n\nCreate Undead\n6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black onyx stone for each corpse)\nDuration: Instantaneous You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)  As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.  The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.\n\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell\nusing an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.\n\nCreation\n5th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create)\nDuration:SpecialYou pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of\na form and material that you have seen before.\nThe duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.\nMaterial               Duration    \nVegetable matter       1 day       \nStone or crystal       12 hours    \nPrecious  metals       1 hour      \nGems                   10 minutes  \nAdamantine or mithral  1 minute    \n\nUsing any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.\n\nCure Wounds\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Instantaneous\nA creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.\n\nDancing Lights\nEvocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.  As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.\n\nDarkness\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.  If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.  If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.\n\nDarkvision\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)\nDuration:8 hoursYou touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.\n\nDaylight\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:1 hourA 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.\nIf you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.\nIf any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.\n\nDeath Ward\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:8 hoursYou touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.\nThe first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.\nIf the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.\n\nDelayed Blast Fireball\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.  If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.  The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.\n\nDemiplane\n8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: 1 hour You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.  Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell.

When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.  You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature-what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.  Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.  You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.  Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.\n"], "response": "If a creature fails its Charisma saving throw against *Contact Other Plane*, it becomes charmed by the caster.

You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.

Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.

For example:\n  - *At 5th level*: DC = 15 + caster's spellcasting ability modifier.\n  - *At 7th level*: DC = 16 + caster's spellcasting ability modifier.\n- This makes the saving throw more difficult as the spell is cast at higher levels, increasing the likelihood of the target being charmed.\n\n### 2. **Telepathic Link**\n- Both spells allow the caster to **telepathically communicate** with the charmed target.\n  - **Dominate Beast**: The caster can communicate with the beast in its language, and the beast understands the caster's telepathic messages. However, the communication is limited to simple commands or ideas, as beasts lack the linguistic complexity of humanoids.\n  - **Dominate Person**: The caster can communicate with the humanoid in the caster's language, and the humanoid understands and speaks the caster's language. This allows for more nuanced and complex communication, including detailed instructions or persuasion.\n- The **telepathic link** does not require the target to be within line of effect, as it operates through the spell's magical effect.\n\n### 3. **Duration**\n- **Both spells last for 1 hour** regardless of the spell level. Even when cast at higher levels, the duration does not increase. This is a key limitation, as the spell's effect is time-bound.\n- The spell ends if the charmed creature takes **damage from a source other than the caster or their allies** (e.g., an attack from an enemy). This applies to both *Dominate Beast* and *Dominate Person*.\n\n### 4. **Key Differences Between the Spells**\n- **Target Type**: *Dominate Beast* targets **beasts**, while *Dominate Person* targets **humanoids**.\n- **Command Complexity**: *Dominate Person* allows for more complex and detailed commands due to the humanoid's ability to understand and speak the caster's language. *Dominate Beast* is limited to simple, direct commands.\n- **Telepathic Communication**: While both allow telepathy, the depth and complexity of communication are greater with *Dominate Person*.\n\n### Summary\nBoth *Dominate Beast* and *Dominate Person* rely on a Wisdom saving throw, with the DC increasing at higher spell levels. The telepathic link allows for communication, but *Dominate Person* permits more nuanced interactions due to the humanoid's linguistic capabilities. The duration of both spells is fixed at 1 hour, and the spell ends if the charmed creature takes damage from an external source.", "reference": "Both Dominate Beast and Dominate Person are enchantment spells that beguile a creature with a Wisdom sving throw. Dominate Beast is a 4th‑level spell while Dominate Person is a 5th‑level spell. The casting time, range, and components are identical: 1 action, 60 feet, verbal and somatic. The duration is concentration, up to 1 minute, and the spell can be extended by using higher level slots. For Dominate Beast the duration becomes 10 minutes with a 5th‑level slot, 1 hour with a 6th‑level slot, and 8 hours with a 7th‑level or higher slot. Dominate Person follows the same pattern but the base spell is one level higher, so the spell can be cast with a 6th‑level slot for 10 minutes, a 7th‑level slot for 1 hour, and a 8th‑level or higher slot for 8 hours. The mechanics of the telepathic link, the ability to issue simple commands, and the option to take total and precise control are identical for both spells. The only difference is the creature type that can be targeted: Dominate Beast can target beasts, while Dominate Person can target humanoids. Both spells require a Wisdom sving throw; if the target succeeds it is not charmed, and if it fails it is charmed for the duration. Each time the charmed creature takes damage it must make a new Wisdom sving throw, and a successful throw ends the spell. The spells also grant the caster a telepathic link with the target as long as both are on the same plane of existence. Because Dominate Person is a higher level spell, it can be cast with a higher level slot to achieve the same extended durations as Dominate Beast, but it is limited to humanoids.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.  Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.  When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again  While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has.

Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.  You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.  Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.\nYour steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.\nWhen the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.\nWhile your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.\nYou can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.\n\nFind the Path\n6th-level divination\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools-such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes-worth 100 gp and an object from the location you wish to find)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 dayThis spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn’t specific (such as “a green dragon’s lair”), the spell fails.\nFor the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are\ntraveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.\n\nFind Traps\n2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.  This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.\n\nFinger of Death\n7th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain.

If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.  If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.  If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.\n\nFloating Disk\n1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.  The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.  If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.\n\nFly\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You touch a willing creature.

For the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the\ngatespell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the\nplane shiftspell.\nIn addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.\nThe spell’s area can’t overlap with the area ofanother\nforbiddancespell. If you cast forbiddance\nevery day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.\n\nForcecage\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 100 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 1 hour An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.  When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.  A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. This spell can’t be dispelled by dispel magic.\n\nForesight\n9th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)\nDuration: 8 hours You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future.

Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target’s movement or attacks.\n\nFreezing Sphere\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:300 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)\nDuration:InstantaneousA frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.\nIf the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.\n"], "response": "False Life is a 1st-level spell that gives a creature temporary hit points equal to 10 + 2 per character level (minimum 10).

When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.  Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.  When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.\nYour steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.\nWhen the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.\nWhile your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.\nYou can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.\n\nFlaming Sphere\n2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minuteA 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAs a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere’s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.\nWhen you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.\n\nFlesh to Stone\n6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteYou attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range\ninto stone. If the target’s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected.\nA creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each\nof its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.  If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.  If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.\n\nFloating Disk\n1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.  The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.  If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.\n\nFly\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nFog Cloud\n1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 hourYou create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.\n\nForbiddance\n6th-level abjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time:10 minutes\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)\nDuration:1 dayYou create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the\ngatespell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the\nplane shiftspell.\nIn addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.\nThe spell’s area can’t overlap with the area ofanother\nforbiddancespell. If you cast forbiddance\nevery day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.\n\nForcecage\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 100 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 1 hour An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.  A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.  A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.  When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.  A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. This spell can’t be dispelled by dispel magic.\n\nForesight\n9th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)\nDuration: 8 hours You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target can’t be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.  This spell immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.\n\nFreedom of Movement\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)\nDuration:1 hourYou touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target’s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.\nThe target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically\nescape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target’s movement or attacks.\n\nFreezing Sphere\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:300 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)\nDuration:InstantaneousA frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.\nIf the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.\n"], "response": "The *Flesh to Stone* spell transforms a creature into a statue of solid stone.

The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn’t affected.  While in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces.

The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.  The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.\nDeities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work).

For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.  The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.\n\nGiant Insect\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.  Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.  A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.  The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.\n\nGlibness\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 hour Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.\n\nGlobe of Invulnerability\n6th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\nComponents:V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteAn immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.\nAny spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.\n\nGlyph of Warding\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 hour\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:Until dispelled or triggeredWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.  When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.  When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects. Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.\nCorridors.

In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.\nDoors.

On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made\nagainst this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.\nAt Higher Levels.

Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.  Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.  The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.  As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.\n\nHallow\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 24 hours\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power.

First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.\nSecond, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls.

The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn’t affected.  While in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can’t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.  While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with.

The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.  The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.\nDeities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is\nfree to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.\n\nGeas\n5th-level enchantment\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V\nDuration:30 daysYou place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you,\nit takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.\nYou can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.\nYou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A\nremove curse,greater restoration, or\nwishspell also ends it.\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.\n\nGentle Repose\n2nd-level necromancy (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse’s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)\nDuration: 10 days You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.  The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.\n\nGiant Insect\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.  Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.  A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.  The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.\n\nGlibness\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 hour Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.\n\nGlobe of Invulnerability\n6th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\nComponents:V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteAn immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.\nAny spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.\n\nGlyph of Warding\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 hour\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:Until dispelled or triggeredWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.  When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.\n\nGoodberry\n1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)\nDuration: Instantaneous Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.  The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.\n\nGrease\n1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)\nDuration:1 minuteSlick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.\nWhen the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.\n\nGreater Invisibility\n4th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteYou or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends.

The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.\n\nGuards and Wards\n6th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)\nDuration: 24 hours You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.  When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects. Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.\nCorridors.

Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.  A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.\n\nImprisonment\n9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target)\nDuration: Until dispelled You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range.

The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\nEnding the Spell.During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition\nis reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.  You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.

If the target is still paralyzed at the end of this duration, they remain incapacitated until the spell ends or they are moved by another creature (e.g., a ally dragging them away).  \n   - If the target is moved, the spell ends. This creates a strategic element: the party might need to coordinate to keep the target immobilized or risk the spell ending.  \n\n3. **Multiple Targets**:  \n   - *Hold person* only affects **one humanoid** at a time. To target multiple individuals, the caster must cast the spell separately for each. This could be a tactical limitation in a fight with multiple enemies.  \n\n4. **Higher Levels**:  \n   - The spell’s effect doesn’t scale with higher spell slots (unlike some other spells, such as *fireball*). However, a higher-level caster with a better Wisdom modifier will have a higher DC, increasing the chance of success. This could be a narrative tool to emphasize the caster’s growing power.  \n\n**Story Impact**:  \n- *Hold person* is ideal for scenes where a character needs to pin down an enemy, such as a rogue immobilizing a guard or a wizard disabling an antagonist. The spell’s duration allows for prolonged control, but its single-target limitation adds tension.  \n- If the target succeeds, it could create a moment of defiance or surprise, such as a foe breaking free and attacking.  \n- The spell’s restriction to humanoids means it won’t work on beasts or constructs, which could be a plot point (e.g., a monster immune to *hold person*).  \n\n**Example Scenario**:  \nA bard casts *hold person* on a goblin guard. The goblin fails the saving throw and freezes mid-step. The bard’s ally quickly disarms the goblin, while the bard prepares a follow-up spell. If the goblin had succeeded, the bard might have had to rely on stealth or a different tactic.", "reference": "Hold Person is a 2nd-level enchantment. Casting Time: 1 action. Range: 60 feet.

Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends.\n\nHunter’s Mark\n1st-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry.

To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.  Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.  A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.\n\nImprisonment\n9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target)\nDuration: Until dispelled You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again.

Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target.\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.\nBurial.The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere\nof magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.\n\nChaining.Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\nHedged Prison.The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\nMinimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\n\nSlumber.The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\nEnding the Spell.During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition\nis reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.  You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.\n\nIncendiary Cloud\n8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.  When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.  The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.\n\nInflict Wounds\n1st-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach.

The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere’s area is difficult terrain.\nWhen the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.\n\nInstant Summons\n6th-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000 gp)\nDuration:Until dispelledYou touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly in scribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.\nAt any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item’s name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.\nIf another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that moment.\nDispel magicor a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this spell’s effect.\n\nInvisibility\n2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 hourA creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s\nperson. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.\nAt Higher Levels.

The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this spell.  A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.\n"], "response": "The 6th-level necromancy spell *Harm* is a powerful and persistent effect that deals necrotic damage and reduces a target’s maximum hit points. Here are the precise mechanics and limitations:\n\n### **Damage Calculation and Hit Point Reduction**\n- **On a failed Constitution saving throw (DC 17):** The target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and has its **maximum hit points reduced by 2d6**. This reduction lasts until the target regains hit points (e.g., through rest, magical healing, or other means that restore hit points).\n- **On a successful save:** The target takes no damage and its maximum hit points are not reduced.\n\n### **Conditions for Restoring Maximum Hit Points**\n- The **maximum hit point reduction is restored only when the target regains hit points**. This can occur through:\n  - Resting (long or short rest, as per the rules for regaining hit points).\n  - Magical effects that grant hit points (e.g., *Healing Word*, *Cure Wounds*, or *Greater Restoration*).\n  - Other effects that explicitly restore hit points (e.g., *Lifesaving* or *Raise Dead*).\n\n### **Interactions with Disease Removal Effects**\n- *Harm* does not involve diseases, so **there is no direct interaction** between the spell and disease removal effects (e.g., *Remove Disease* or *Purify Food and Drink*). The spell’s effects are purely based on hit point reduction and necrotic damage, not on biological conditions like diseases.\n\n### **Key Limitations**\n- **No saving throw to avoid the hit point reduction:** The reduction is applied only if the target fails the Constitution save.\n- **Persistent effect:** The reduced maximum hit points persist until the target regains hit points, which can be a significant and long-term debuff.\n- **No self-benefit or restoration:** The spell does not grant any benefit to the caster and has no self-removal or duration beyond its initial casting.\n\nIn summary, *Harm* is a spell that combines immediate damage with a persistent debuff, but its effects are tied to the target’s ability to regain hit points, not to diseases or other unrelated conditions.", "reference": "Harm is a 6th‑level necromancy spell that requires a 1‑action casting time, a range of 60 feet, and verbal and somatic components.

The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.\nYou can use your action to control the hand.

If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.\n•The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.\n•Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed,frightened, or possessed by the creature.When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nMagic Jar\n6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)\nDuration:Until dispelled\nYour body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell’s material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.  You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circlespell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.  Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.  Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.  While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.  If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies. When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.\n\nMagic Missile\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.\n\nMagic Mouth\n2nd-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:Until dispelledYou implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.\nWhen that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell,\nyou can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.\nThe triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.\n\nMagic Weapon\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 bonus action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.\n\nMagnificent Mansion\n7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration: 24 hours You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.  Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.  You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.\n\nMajor Image\n3rd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature\n(like a troglodyte’s stench).\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.\n\nMass Cure Wounds\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousA wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.\n\nMass Heal\n9th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nMass Healing Word\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nMass Suggestion\n6th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)\nDuration: 24 hours You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.  Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn’t met before the spell ends, the activity isn’t performed.\nIf you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.\n"], "response": "The *magic mouth* spell is a 2nd-level divination spell that creates a mouth and a voice that can speak, sing, or chant for up to 1 minute.

You sense the direction to the creature’s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.\nThe spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close-within 30 feet-at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a\npolymorphspell, this spell doesn’t locate the creature.\nThis spell can’t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.\n\nLocate Object\n2nd-level divination\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S, M (a forked twig)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nDescribe or name an object that is familiar to you.

The target’s speed increases by 10 feet until the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.\n\nMage Armor\n1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)\nDuration: 8 hours You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target’s base AC becomes 13 +its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.\n\nMage Hand\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.\nYou can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.\nThe hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.\n\nMagic Circle\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:10 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:1 hourYou create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.\nChoose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead.\nThe circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:\n•The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.\n•The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.\n•Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed,frightened, or possessed by the creature.When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nMagic Jar\n6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)\nDuration:Until dispelled\nYour body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell’s material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.  You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circlespell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.  Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.  Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.  While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.  If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies. When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.\n\nMagic Missile\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.\n\nMagic Mouth\n2nd-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:Until dispelledYou implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.\nWhen that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell,\nyou can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.\nThe triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.\n\nMagic Weapon\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 bonus action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.\n\nMagnificent Mansion\n7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration: 24 hours You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.  Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.  You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.\n\nMajor Image\n3rd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature\n(like a troglodyte’s stench).\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.\n\nMass Cure Wounds\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousA wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.\n\nMass Heal\n9th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nMass Healing Word\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nMass Suggestion\n6th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)\nDuration: 24 hours You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.  Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn’t met before the spell ends, the activity isn’t performed.\nIf you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.\n"], "response": "*Divination (ritual)*\n**Casting Time:** 10 minutes\n**Range:** Self\n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n**Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of hawthorn)\nYou magically detect the presence of certain animals or plants within 1 mile of you.

{"user_input": "What are the implications of a character havin truesight in a world where darkness and magical obscurities abound, and how can a narrativeist use this ability to enrich the setting, create intrigue, and weave lore about ancient guardians or hidden truths that can be revealed only to those with truesight?", "reference_contexts": ["The Environment By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places. Falling A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall. Suffocating A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again. For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points. Vision and Light The most fundamental tasks of adventuring-noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few-rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance. A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. A heavily obscured area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix PH-A) when trying to see something in that area. The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness. Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius. Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light. Darknesscreates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness. Blindsight A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense. Darkvision Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Truesight A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane. Food and Water Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix PH-A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount. Food A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food. A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero. Water A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case. Interacting with Objects A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens. For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task. Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an"], "response": "In a world steeped in darkness and magical obscurations, a character with *truesight* becomes a pivotal figure, their ability to perceive the unseen shaping both the narrative and the mechanics of the game. Here’s how this power can be leveraged to enrich the setting and deepen the story:\n\n### **Implications of Truesight**\n1. **Perception of Hidden Threats**: Truesight allows the character to see through illusions, magical darkness, and other obfuscations, revealing hidden dangers—such as lurking monsters, traps, or ancient guardians—that would otherwise remain invisible. This creates tension, as the character must navigate a world where danger is often unseen by others.\n2. **Access to Forbidden Knowledge**: The ability to see through magical obscurations can grant access to secrets hidden by ancient magic, such as inscriptions on ruins, spectral messages, or the true forms of cursed artifacts. This ties the character to the world’s lore, making them a key figure in uncovering its mysteries.\n3. **Moral and Narrative Burden**: Knowing the truth that others cannot see may place a heavy burden on the character, forcing them to confront moral dilemmas or truths that others are shielded from. This can drive character development and thematic exploration (e.g., the cost of truth, the weight of seeing the world as it truly is).\n\n### **Narrative Opportunities**\n1. **Ancient Guardians and Hidden Truths**: The character’s truesight can be tied to ancient lore, revealing guardians or truths only visible to those with the ability. For example, a guardian might appear only when the character uses their truesight, or a hidden prophecy might be etched in a way that only they can perceive. This creates a sense of destiny or inevitability, enriching the world’s history.\n2. **Plot-Driven Challenges**: Encounters can be designed around the character’s ability. A dungeon’s final chamber might be invisible to all except those with truesight, forcing the party to rely on the character to navigate it. Alternatively, a villain’s illusions or magical defenses might only be broken by the character’s perception, creating unique mechanics and stakes.\n3. **Thematic Depth**: Truesight can symbolize themes like truth, sacrifice, or the burden of knowledge. For instance, the character might be cursed to see the world’s hidden horrors, adding emotional weight to their journey. Alternatively, their ability could be a gift from an ancient power, tying their story to the world’s history.\n\n### **Example Integration**\nImagine a campaign where the character’s truesight is tied to an ancient order of seers. As they explore a cursed forest, their ability reveals spectral trees that whisper forgotten tales, or a hidden temple guarded by a wraith that only appears when the character uses their sight. These revelations could tie into a larger mystery, such as a prophecy about the world’s impending collapse or a forgotten god’s return. The character’s role becomes central to the story, their ability not just a tool but a narrative catalyst.\n\nBy weaving truesight into the world’s mechanics and lore, the narrativeist creates a setting where perception itself becomes a source of power, intrigue, and existential stakes.", "reference": "A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual ilusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.

{"user_input": "How do Hit Dice work during short and long rests in D&D?", "reference_contexts": ["Resting Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure. Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day. Short Rest A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below. Long Rest A longrest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest. A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits. Between Adventures Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold. In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion. Lifestyle Expenses Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle. Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty. Downtime Activities Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity. Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM. Crafting You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor. For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself. Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp. While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost. Practicing a Profession You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead."], "response": "In Dungeons & Dragons, Hit Dice are used to recover hit points during short and long rests, but the mechanics differ between the two types of rest:\n\n### **Short Rest**\n- **Recovery:** During a short rest, a character can roll up to **half their level** (rounded down) in Hit Dice to recover hit points.\n- **Example:** A 5th-level character can roll up to **2 Hit Dice** during a short rest.\n- **Hit Dice Type:** The Hit Dice rolled must be of the character's class (e.g., a wizard rolls 1d6, a fighter rolls 1d10).\n- **Hit Points:** The total number of hit points restored is the sum of the Hit Dice rolled.

Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height. object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks. A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.", "<2-hop>\n\nResting Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure. Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day. Short Rest A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below. Long Rest A longrest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest. A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits. Between Adventures Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold. In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion. Lifestyle Expenses Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle. Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty. Downtime Activities Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity. Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM. Crafting You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor. For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself. Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp. While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost. Practicing a Profession You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.

Special Types of Movement Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go. Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed.

{"user_input": "Wha are some Sample Traps?", "reference_contexts": ["Traps\nTraps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.  A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature.\nMechanical traps include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate.\nMagic traps are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.\n\nTraps in Play\nWhen adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.\n\nTriggering a Trap\nMost traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.\n\nDetecting and Disabling a Trap\nUsually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.  A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an\nIntelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.\nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic\ntrap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition,\ndispel magichas a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use\ndispel magic.\nIn most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.\nYou should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.\nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a\ntrapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.\nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.\n\nTrap Effects\nThe effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.  The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.  A trap intended to be a\nsetback is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a\ndangerous trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A\ndeadly trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.\n\nTrap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses\nTrap Danger  Save DC  Attack Bonus  \nSetback      10 - 11  +3 to +5      \nDangerous    12-15    +6 to +8      \nDeadly       16 - 20  +9 to +12     \n\n\nDamage Severity by Level\nCharacter Level  Setback  Dangerous  Deadly  \n1st-4th          1d10     2d10       4d10    \n5th-10th         2d10     4d10       10d10   \n11th - 16th      4d10     10d10      18d10   \n17th - 20th      10d10    18d10      24d10   \n\n\nComplex Traps\nComplex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.  When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.  For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.\n\nSample Traps\nThe magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.\n\nCollapsing Roof\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nAnyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.\nThe ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it’s in danger of collapse.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.\n\nFalling Net\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10\nStrength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.\n\nFire-Breathing Statue\nMagic trap This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.  The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.  The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.\n\nPits\nMechanical trap Four basic pit traps are presented here.\nSimple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.  The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).\nHidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.  A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.  When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.\nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the\narcane lockspell or similar magic.\nLocking Pit.This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.\nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In\nsome cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.\nSpiked Pit.This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the\npit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nPoison Darts\nMechanical trap\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.\nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8\nbonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nPoison Needle\nMechanical trap A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.  When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.  A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.\n\nRolling Sphere\nMechanical trap When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.  With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.  Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.\nThe sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.\nAs an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.\n\nSphere of Annihilation\nMagic trap\nMagical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a\nsphere of annihilation\nthat can’t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal\nsphere of annihilation\n.\nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the\nsympathyaspect of the antipathy/sympathy\nspell. A successful dispel magic(DC 18) removes this enchantment.\n"], "response": "In Dungeons & Dragons, a **trap** is an obstacle or hazard that challenges the party, often requiring careful navigation, skill checks, or clever problem-solving to avoid or disable. Traps can be mechanical, magical, or even psychological, and they are designed to be both dangerous and thematically appropriate for the setting. Here are some **sample traps** commonly found in D&D adventures, categorized by type:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Mechanical Traps**\n- **Pressure Plates**: Activated by weight or pressure, triggering spikes, falling rocks, or other deadly effects.\n- **Spring-Loaded Arrows**: Hidden in walls or furniture, firing arrows at intruders.\n- **Collapsing Floors**: Weak sections of a floor that give way, dropping characters into pits or onto spikes.\n- **Spiked Pits**: Deep pits lined with sharpened stakes or spikes.\n- **Saw Blades**: Rotating blades that slice through anything that passes through them.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Magical Traps**\n- **Fire Traps**: Flames or fireballs that erupt when triggered, often with area-of-effect damage.\n- **Teleportation Traps**: Transport characters to another location, sometimes with disorientation or danger.\n- **Illusion Traps**: Confuse or mislead players, such as false doors or misleading paths.\n- **Poison Gas**: Released when a trap is triggered, causing damage or debuffs.\n- **Petrification or Enchantment Traps**: Magical effects that turn victims to stone or control them.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Puzzle Traps**\n- **Alignment Checks**: Detect the alignment of characters (e.g., a trap that only activates if a character is evil).\n- **Lever Puzzles**: Require solving a sequence of levers to disable a trap.\n- **Symbol Traps**: Activated by touching specific symbols or runes, often with magical consequences.\n- **Time-Limited Traps**: Require quick action to disable before they activate (e.g., a clockwork trap that explodes after a certain time).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Biological Traps**\n- **Poisonous Plants**: Touching certain plants or stepping on them triggers a poison effect.\n- **Infested Areas**: Creatures or undead (e.g., zombies) are released when a trap is triggered.\n- **Toxic Gas**: Released from hidden vents, causing damage or debuffs.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Social Traps**\n- **False Doors**: Doors that appear solid but are illusions, leading to pitfalls or traps when touched.\n- **Invisible Traps**: Require a successful Perception or other skill check to detect.\n- **Bargain Traps**: Characters are lured into a deal that backfires, such as a contract with a demon.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Environmental Traps**\n- **Collapsing Bridges**: Bridges that break under weight or after a certain amount of time.\n- **Falling Rocks**: Triggered by noise or movement, dropping boulders on intruders.\n- **Flooded Rooms**: Water rises rapidly, drowning or forcing characters to swim or find higher ground.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Special Traps**\n- **Fey Traps**: Magical effects tied to fey magic, such as illusions or curses.\n- **Undead Traps**: Skeletons or other undead are animated when a trap is triggered.\n- **Divine Traps**: Designed by clerics or divine beings, often with holy or infernal effects.\n\n---\n\n### **How Traps Work in the Game**\n- **Triggering**: Most traps have a specific trigger (e.g., \"when a creature steps on this tile\").\n- **Disarm Checks**: Players can attempt to disarm a trap with a skill check (e.g., Dexterity for mechanical traps, Arcana for magical ones).\n- **Consequences**: If a trap is not disarmed, it activates, dealing damage or other penalties.\n- **Detection**: Some traps are invisible or hidden, requiring Perception or other skills to detect.\n\n---\n\n### **Designing Effective Traps**\n- **Balance**: Traps should challenge players without being outright deadly.\n- **Theming**: Traps should match the dungeon’s setting (e.g., a castle might have mechanical traps, while a crypt might have undead traps).\n- **Creativity**: Traps can be used to enhance the story, such as revealing secrets or forcing players to think creatively.\n\nTraps are a key element of dungeon exploration, adding tension and rewarding players who use their skills and wit.", "reference": "Sample Traps are the listed mechanical and magic traps such as Collapsing Roof, Falling Net, Fire‑Breathing Statue, the various pit traps, Poison Darts, Poison Needle, Rolling Sphere, and Sphere of Annihilation.", "answer_relevancy": 0.6255841574710898, "semantic_similarity": 0.43152156328098323, "bleu_score": 0.014106375825866007, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.041666666666666664, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.02195945945945946, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.40625}

One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.  A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature.\nMechanical traps include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate.\nMagic traps are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.\n\nTraps in Play\nWhen adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.\n\nTriggering a Trap\nMost traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.\n\nDetecting and Disabling a Trap\nUsually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.  A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an\nIntelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.\nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic\ntrap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition,\ndispel magichas a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use\ndispel magic.\nIn most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.\nYou should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.\nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a\ntrapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.\nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.\n\nTrap Effects\nThe effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.  The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.  A trap intended to be a\nsetback is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a\ndangerous trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A\ndeadly trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.\n\nTrap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses\nTrap Danger  Save DC  Attack Bonus  \nSetback      10 - 11  +3 to +5      \nDangerous    12-15    +6 to +8      \nDeadly       16 - 20  +9 to +12     \n\n\nDamage Severity by Level\nCharacter Level  Setback  Dangerous  Deadly  \n1st-4th          1d10     2d10       4d10    \n5th-10th         2d10     4d10       10d10   \n11th - 16th      4d10     10d10      18d10   \n17th - 20th      10d10    18d10      24d10   \n\n\nComplex Traps\nComplex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.  When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.  For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.\n\nSample Traps\nThe magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.\n\nCollapsing Roof\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nAnyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.\nThe ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it’s in danger of collapse.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.\n\nFalling Net\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10\nStrength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.\n\nFire-Breathing Statue\nMagic trap This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.  The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.  The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.\n\nPits\nMechanical trap Four basic pit traps are presented here.\nSimple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.  The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).\nHidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.  A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.  When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.\nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the\narcane lockspell or similar magic.\nLocking Pit.This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.\nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In\nsome cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.\nSpiked Pit.This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the\npit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nPoison Darts\nMechanical trap\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.\nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8\nbonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nPoison Needle\nMechanical trap A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.  When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.  A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.\n\nRolling Sphere\nMechanical trap When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.  With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.  Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.\nThe sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.\nAs an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.\n\nSphere of Annihilation\nMagic trap\nMagical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a\nsphere of annihilation\nthat can’t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal\nsphere of annihilation\n.\nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the\nsympathyaspect of the antipathy/sympathy\nspell. A successful dispel magic(DC 18) removes this enchantment.\n"], "response": "**Pits in Dungeons & Dragons: Mechanics, Detection, and Narrative Use**\n\n**1. Pit Types and Mechanics**  \n- **Simple Pit:** A basic trap that drops the target into a pit. Damage is typically 1d6 bludgeoning per 10 feet of fall (see *Player’s Handbook* p. 194). **DC 12** for Perception to notice, **DC 15** for Investigation to disable.  \n- **Hidden Pit:** Concealed by floorboards or rugs. Requires a **DC 13** Wisdom (Perception) check to detect. **DC 15** for Investigation to disable.  \n- **Locking Pit:** The pit’s edges are lined with spikes or bars that prevent escape. The target must make a **DC 14** Strength (Athletics) or **DC 15** Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to climb out.  \n- **Spiked Pit:** Lined with sharpened stakes or spikes. On a failed **DC 13** Dexterity save, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage. **DC 14** for Investigation to disable.  \n\n**2. Detection and Disabling**  \n- **Detection:** Characters can use **Perception (DC 12–15)** or **Investigation (DC 15–17)** to spot hidden mechanisms.  \n- **Disabling:** Requires **Investigation (DC 15–17)** or **Arcana (DC 16)** for magical traps. Success removes the trap or reduces damage.  \n\n**3. Creative Narrative Use**  \n- **Environmental Storytelling:** A hidden pit could reveal a long-lost civilization’s remains, hinting at a deeper mystery.  \n- **Character Development:** A spiked pit forces the party to work together (e.g., using grappling hooks or ropes).  \n- **Plot Relevance:** A locking pit might imprison a key NPC, requiring a quest to free them.  \n- **Thematic Contrast:** A pit in a noble’s estate could symbolize hidden corruption, while one in a dungeon reflects the dungeon’s cruelty.  \n\n**4. Interesting Flavors**  \n- **Magical Pits:** Trap the target in a dimension or bind them to a curse (e.g., *Hold Person* or *Hold Monster*).  \n- **Traps with Traps:** A pit could contain a secondary trap (e.g., a fire pit or a creature).  \n- **Moral Dilemmas:** A pit might force choices (e.g., sacrificing an ally to disable it).  \n\n**Example Encounter:**  \nA hidden pit in a noble’s hall drops a character into a chamber with a ghost. The ghost’s presence is a clue to a larger plot, and the pit’s mechanism is tied to a magical seal.  \n\nUse these ideas to integrate pits into your campaign, balancing challenge and storytelling!", "reference": "Pits are a type of mechanical trap.

{"user_input": "Could you explain, in a detailed step‑by‑step manner, how a character should use a Wisdom (Perception) check to detect a trap, including how the DC is determined, how passive perception can be used, and what happens if the check succeeds or fails, as described in the provided context?", "reference_contexts": ["Detecting and Disabling a Trap Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence. A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage. Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, dispel magichas a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use dispel magic. In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt. You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required. Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield. Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap."], "response": "When a character uses a Wisdom (Perception) check to detect a trap, the process involves determining the trap's difficulty class (DC), the character's passive Perception score, and the outcome of the check. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Determine the Trap's DC**: The trap has a DC of 15, which is the target number the character must meet or exceed on their Wisdom (Perception) check to detect it.\n\n2. **Use Passive Perception (if applicable)**: If the character is not actively searching for traps, they can use their passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13. However, passive checks are typically used for passive awareness, not for actively detecting hidden or complex traps like this one.\n\n3. **Make the Active Wisdom (Perception) Check**: If the character is actively searching for traps, they must roll a Wisdom (Perception) check. The DC of 15 means they need to roll a 15 or higher, or beat their own passive score if it's lower than the DC (which it isn't in this case, as 13 < 15).\n\n4. **Success Outcome**: If the check succeeds (rolling 15 or higher), the character detects the trap. They become aware of its presence, such as noticing tripwires, pressure plates, or other indicators. This allows them to avoid or disarm the trap.\n\n5. **Failure Outcome**: If the check fails (rolling 14 or lower), the character does not detect the trap. They may inadvertently trigger it, leading to the trap's effects (e.g., damage, being restrained, or other consequences).\n\nIn summary, the character's success or failure on the Wisdom (Perception) check determines whether they detect the trap and avoid its effects, with the DC and their passive score playing critical roles in the outcome.", "reference": "1.

Decide whether the character will actively look for the trap. If so, the character makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\n3. Roll the Wisdom (Perception) check and compare the result to the trap’s DC. If the roll is equal to or higher than the DC, the character successfully detects the trap.\n4. If the character does not actively look, the Dungeon Master can compare the trap’s DC to each party member’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score. If a passive score meets or exceeds the DC, that character notices the trap while passing by.\n5. If the check succeeds, the adventurers know the trap’s presence before it is triggered. They can then attempt to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it, or take other precautions.\n6. If the check fails, the trap remains hidden until it is triggered or until another action reveals it.\n7. In some cases, a character’s action can reveal the trap without a check. For example, lifting a rug that conceals a pressure plate immediately shows the trigger, so no Wisdom (Perception) check is required.\n8.

Cantrips You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table. Spell Slots The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. Eldritch Invocations In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. Pact Boon At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice. Pact of the Chain You learn the find familiarspell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. Pact of the Blade You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. Pact of the Tome Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

The three types of pacts—The Archfey, The Fiend, and The Great Old One—each provide unique boons that influence the nature of the warlock's bond with their patron, offering distinct narrative opportunities:\n\n1. **The Archfey Pact**: This pact involves a patron who is a powerful fey entity, often capricious and whimsical. The boon might manifest as a magical ability tied to fey magic, such as the ability to manipulate dreams or create illusions. Narrative opportunities could include quests that test the warlock's loyalty or morality, as fey patrons often demand strange or seemingly irrational tasks. The relationship might be strained by the patron's unpredictability, leading to moments of tension or growth as the warlock navigates their patron's whims.\n\n2. **The Fiend Pact**: A patron from the Nine Hells, such as a demon or devil, offers a pact that emphasizes power through infernal magic. The boon might involve abilities like summoning hellish creatures or gaining infernal energy. The warlock's relationship with their patron could be one of mutual benefit but also of fear or coercion, as fiends often demand sacrifices or servitude. This dynamic can lead to morally ambiguous scenarios, where the warlock must balance their desire for power with the cost of their patron's demands.\n\n3. **The Great Old One Pact**: This pact is with an ancient, cosmic entity, often tied to eldritch magic and madness. The boon might grant abilities that reflect the patron's alien nature, such as telepathy or the ability to summon eldritch forces. The relationship here is likely to be one of reverence and fear, as the patron's power is vast and incomprehensible. The narrative could explore themes of obsession, madness, or the cost of wielding such ancient power, with the warlock possibly facing existential threats or the slow erosion of their sanity.\n\nEach pact's boon not only shapes the warlock's abilities but also provides a framework for storytelling, allowing players to explore themes of power, sacrifice, and the complexities of patronage.

I should also explain the differences between Pact Magic and other spellcasting classes and the significance of Pact Magic in the Warlock class. Let me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the basics: at level 1, Warlocks get 1 spell slot of 1st level, 1 cantrip, and a choice of 3 invocations. The Pact Boon at level 1 is a basic spellcasting ability with a specific spell. At level 2, the Pact Boon becomes more powerful, and spell slots increase. I need to track how spell slots change at each level, making sure to note when they increase and the level of the slots. For example, at level 3, spell slots go to 2, and the highest level is 3rd. I'll have to make sure that each level is covered, with the spell slots and their levels, the number of cantrips, spells known, and invocations. The Pact Boon changes at certain levels, so I should list those changes. Also, the Otherworldly Patron's influence on the Pact Boon should be mentioned. I need to compare Pact Magic with other spellcasting classes, noting that Warlocks have fewer slots and spells but more flexibility with invocations. Finally, I should explain the significance of Pact Magic in the Warlock class, emphasizing its role in defining the subclass's abilities and thematic elements. Let me ensure that all levels from 1 to 20 are included, with accurate numbers for spell slots, cantrips, spells known, and invocations. I'll also need to check that the Pact Boon's progression is correctly described, from level 1 to 20, and that the Otherworldly Patron's impact is clearly explained. This will ensure the answer is thorough and covers all the user's questions.\n</think>\n\nThe **Pact Magic** subclass for Warlocks is a unique and powerful spellcasting system that defines the subclass's abilities, progression, and thematic role. Below is a detailed breakdown of its features, mechanics, and significance, organized by level, spellcasting progression, and how it differentiates from other spellcasting classes.\n\n---\n\n### **Level Progression & Spellcasting Mechanics**\nAt each level, Warlocks gain spell slots, cantrips, and invocations, with the **Pact Boon** evolving to grant more potent spells or abilities. Here's how key features change from **Level 1 to 20**:\n\n---\n\n#### **Level 1**\n- **Spell Slots**: 1 spell slot of 1st level.\n- **Cantrips**: 1 cantrip known.\n- **Spells Known**: 0 spells (spells are learned at higher levels via the **Pact Boon**).\n- **Invocations Known**: 3 invocations (choose 3 from the list).\n- **Pact Boon**: A 1st-level spell (e.g., *shatter*, *thunderwave*, *thunderbolt*) with a specific effect tied to the subclass’s Otherworldly Patron.\n\n---\n\n#### **Level 2**\n- **Spell Slots**: 2 slots, both 1st level.\n- **Pact Boon**: Upgrades to a 2nd-level spell (e.g., *burning hands*, *misty step*).\n- **Otherworldly Patron**: Grants a unique ability (e.g., *Eldritch Blast* for the Archfey Patron, *Shadow Magic* for the Shadow Patron).\n\n---\n\n####

Otherworldly Patron.\n- **Cantrips**: 1 cantrip known at 1st level, with no additional cantrips gained later (unlike other spellcasters).\n- **Invocations**: 3 known at 1st level, with no additional invocations (unlike other subclasses like Eldritch Knight or Circle of the Moon).\n\n---\n\n### **How Pact Magic Differs from Other Spellcasting Classes**\n- **Spells Known**: Warlocks only gain 1 new spell per level (starting at 2nd), while wizards gain 2 and clerics gain 1.\n- **Spell Slots**: Warlocks have fewer slots than wizards or clerics but can use them more flexibly (e.g., via **Eldritch Blast**).\n- **Cantrips**: Warlocks only learn 1 cantrip at 1st level, while other classes like wizards or clerics learn 3 or 4.\n- **Flexibility**: Warlocks trade spell variety for invocations, which are powerful class features tied to their patron.\n\n---\n\n### **Significance of Pact Magic**\n- **Thematic Core**: Pact Magic defines the Warlock’s relationship with their patron and their role as a spellcaster.\n- **Progression**: The subclass’s power scales with the **Pact Boon**, which evolves to match the Warlock’s growing strength.\n- **Balance**: Warlocks are designed to be less versatile than wizards or clerics but more flavorful and thematic, with invocations and patrons adding depth.\n- **Roleplay**: The Pact Boon and Otherworldly Patron tie the Warlock’s abilities to their story, making them a unique class in the game.\n\n---\n\n### **Pact Boon & Otherworldly Patron Interaction**\n- **Pact Boon**: At each level, the **Pact Boon** becomes a more powerful spell (e.g., 1st → 2nd → 3rd, etc.), reflecting the Warlock’s growing power.\n- **Otherworldly Patron**: Each patron provides a unique ability (e.g., **Eldritch Blast** for the Archfey Patron) that synergizes with the Pact Boon, creating a cohesive subclass identity.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, **Pact Magic** is a streamlined, flexible, and thematic spellcasting system that emphasizes the Warlock’s bond with their patron, while trading versatility for flavor and roleplay depth.", "reference": "Pact Magic is a warlock class feature.

The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher.

Eldritch Invocations In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. Pact Boon At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice. Pact of the Chain You learn the find familiarspell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. Pact of the Blade You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. Pact of the Tome Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

Unlike other classes, Warlocks don't prepare spells in advance but instead cast spells from their spell list using a limited number of spell slots, which are determined by their level. Each spell slot has a level, and the spell must be of a level equal to or less than the slot's level. Warlocks can also use a spellcasting focus, such as a wand or a spellbook, to cast spells. The spellcasting focus is a crucial part of Pact Magic, as it allows Warlocks to channel their magic without expending their own energy.

Otherworldly Patrons The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Fiendish Resilience Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance. Hurl Through Hell Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Your Pact Boon Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature. Pact of the Chain. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Pact of the Blade. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. Pact of the Tome. Your Book of Shadows could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend."], "response": "A warlock who has made a pact with a **Fiend** (a demon, devil, or other infernal being) gains a unique set of class features, expanded spell list, and special invocations that reflect their infernal alignment. These elements shape the warlock's combat and role-playing in several ways:\n\n---\n\n### **Class Features (Fiend Pact)**  \n1. **Eldritch Blast (Cantrip):** A signature spell that deals force damage, representing the warlock’s connection to the infernal realm.\n2. **Otherworldly Patron (1st level):** The warlock’s patron grants them a unique ability, such as **Fiendish Resilience (5th level)** (resistance to fire and lightning damage) or **Fiendish Power (11th level)** (increased damage and a chance to reduce a target’s hit points to 0).\n3. **Expanded Spell List:** The warlock’s spell list includes spells that emphasize **debuffing, controlling, and devastating enemies**, such as *Charm Person*, *Flame Strike*, *Hex*, and *Silence*.\n4. **Expanded Cantrips:** The warlock gains cantrips like *Thaumaturgy* (which can be used to create a booming voice or intimidating presence) and *Evocation* spells that reflect infernal fury.\n\n---\n\n### **Special Invocations (Fiend Pact)**  \nThese invocations provide powerful combat and utility abilities:  \n1. **Chains of Binding (1st level):** The warlock can summon chains that bind an enemy, restricting their movement and imposing penalties.\n2. **Devil’s Sight (5th level):** The warlock gains the ability to see through magical darkness, mirroring the infernal patron’s omniscience.\n3. **Familiarity (6th level):** The warlock gains a familiar that can be used for scouting or attacking, representing the patron’s influence.\n4. **Fiend’s Boon (10th level):** The warlock can grant a boon to an ally, such as resistance or a bonus to a saving throw, reflecting the patron’s support.\n5. **Fiend’s Soul (14th level):** The warlock can drain the soul of a dying enemy, granting them temporary hit points or other benefits.\n6. **Soul Steal (17th level):** The warlock can steal a soul, which can be used to power their magic or enhance their abilities.\n7. **Vile Presence (18th level):** The warlock radiates a aura of fear or corruption, affecting enemies in the area.\n\n---\n\n### **Combat and Role-Playing Interaction**  \n- **Combat:** The warlock’s abilities focus on **controlling the battlefield**, **debuffing enemies**, and **dealing damage**. Spells like *Flame Strike* and *Hexblade’s Curse* allow them to target vulnerable foes, while invocations like *Chains of Binding* and *Soul Steal* provide tactical advantages. The warlock is a **versatile spellcaster** who can thrive in both melee and ranged combat.\n- **Role-Playing:** The warlock’s infernal patron influences their personality, often making them **ambitious, cunning, and morally ambiguous**. Their interactions with allies may be strained, as the patron’s influence could manifest in the form of whispers, temptations, or dark bargains. The warlock may also be haunted by the consequences of their pact, such as a growing corruption or a fear of being consumed by the infernal realm.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Narrative Integration**  \nImagine a warlock who has made a pact with a **Devil**. Their invocations, such as *Devil’s Sight* and *Fiend’s Boon*, could be used to manipulate allies or enemies, while their spell *Charm Person* might be used to bend others to their will. In role-playing, the warlock might struggle with the moral implications of their pact, such as whether to use their power for personal gain or to protect the party. In combat, they could use *Flame Strike* to burn through enemies or *Hexblade’s Curse* to weaken a key threat, all while being haunted by the growing influence of their infernal patron.", "reference": "A warlock who has chosen the Fiend as their otherworldly patron gains a number of unique features that are listed in the class description. At 1st level the Fiend grants an expanded spell list that includes burning hands, command, blindness/deafness, scorching ray, fireball, stinking cloud, fire shield, wall of fire, flame strike, hallow, and the special ability Dark One’s Blessing. Dark One’s Blessing gives temporary hit points equal to the warlock’s Charisma modifier plus warlock level whenever a hostile creature is reduced to 0 hit points. At 6th level the warlock can use Dark One’s Own Luck to add a d10 to an ability check or saving throw once per short or long rest. At 10th level the Fiend allows the warlock to choose a damage type for resistance, which can be changed after a short rest; this resistance is ignored by magical or silver weapons. At 14th level the warlock can use Hurl Through Hell to transport a target through the lower planes, dealing 10d10 psychic damage to non‑fiends and returning them after the next turn. The Fiend also provides a special Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain gives a familiar that can be a reflection of the patron, Pact of the Blade gives a weapon that could be an axe of black metal with flames, and Pact of the Tome gives a book bound in demon hide with forbidden lore. These features are complemented by the Thief of Five Fates invocations and features. The Thief of Five Fates allows the warlock to cast bane once per long rest, to attack with a pact weapon twice when taking the Attack action at 5th level (Thirsting Blade), to cast arcane eye at will at 15th level (Visions of Distant Realms), to communicate telepathically with a familiar and perceive through its senses at 15th level (Voice of the Chain Master), to cast speak with dead at will at 9th level (Whispers of the Grave), and to see the true form of shapechangers or illusion‑concealed creatures within 30 feet at 15th level (Witch Sight). When a warlock has a Fiend patron, all of these Thief of Five Fates features stack with the patron’s abilities, allowing the warlock to combine the Fiend’s fire‑based spell options, damage resistances, and planar transport with the Thief’s unique invocations that enhance combat versatility, information gathering, and role‑playing opportunities. Together, they create a warlock who is both a formidable spellcaster with fire and damage‑resistance powers and a versatile combatant who can manipulate the battlefield, gather intelligence, and interact with the world in ways that reflect the Fiend’s malevolent influence.", "answer_relevancy": 0.7633969424649715, "semantic_similarity": 0.6844137141285084, "bleu_score": 0.13210256062092923, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.19279454722492698, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.17010309278350516, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.22247191011235956}

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. Spellbook At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. Preparing and Casting Spells The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell).

With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar). Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example:\n- **Evocation**: *Finger of Death*, a powerful 5th-level spell that can kill a creature with a single strike.\n- **Necromancy**: *Raise Dead*, which allows you to resurrect a dead creature.\n- **Illusion**: *Major Image*, a 3rd-level illusion that creates a realistic image or sound.\n\nAt **14th level**, you gain a **legendary ability** tied to your tradition, such as:\n- **Evocation**: *Power Word, Kill*, an 8th-level spell that instantly kills a creature.\n- **Necromancy**: *Mass Raise Dead*, which can resurrect multiple creatures at once.\n- **Illusion**: *Greater Invisibility*, which grants you invisibility and prevents detection by all means.\n\n### Overall Progression\nYour Arcane Tradition defines your spellcasting, granting you **unique spells** and **progressive abilities** that enhance your role in combat, exploration, and social interactions.

Preparing and Casting Spells The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar). Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. Arcane Tradition When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Spell Mastery At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell"], "response": "Spellcasting in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition is a core mechanic for wizards, allowing them to cast spells using spell slots and their spellbook. Here’s a breakdown of your questions:\n\n**Spellbook**: A wizard’s spellbook is a collection of spells they have learned. At 1st level, you can know up to **6 cantrips** and **6 1st-level spells**. Your spellbook contains all the spells you have learned, and you can add more as you level up.\n\n**Spell Preparation**: At the start of a long rest, you choose which spells to prepare. The number of spells you can prepare depends on your level, and each spell uses one spell slot of the appropriate level when cast.\n\n**Spell Slots**: At 1st level, you have **2 1st-level spell slots**. The number of spell slots increases with your level, and each slot can be used to cast a spell of that level or lower.\n\n**Casting a Spell**: To cast a spell, you expend a spell slot of the spell’s level or higher. You must also meet the spell’s casting time, components, and range requirements. Spells require **verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components**.\n\n**Spellcasting Ability**: For wizards, **Intelligence** is your spellcasting ability. It determines your **spell save DC** (8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) and your **spell attack modifier** (proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier + spellcasting ability modifier).\n\n**Ritual Casting**: You can cast a spell without expending a spell slot by taking **10 minutes** longer than normal. This is useful for spells that require preparation, like *Identify* or *Find Familiar*.\n\n**Focus**: A wizard uses a **focus** (like a crystal or staff) to cast spells without needing material components. The focus is a **reusable item** that doesn’t need to be consumed.\n\n**Learning New Spells**: You can learn new spells by studying your spellbook. At each level, you gain new spell slots, and you can add new spells to your spellbook by finding them in your adventures or learning them from other wizards.\n\n**Arcane Recovery**: This feature allows you to recover **spell slots** during a short rest. You regain **half** of your expended spell slots (rounded down), but you cannot recover more than your level.\n\n**Arcane Traditions**: These are specializations within the wizard class, such as **Evocation, Illusion, or Transmutation**. Each tradition grants unique features and abilities.\n\n**Spell Mastery (18th Level)**: At 18th level, you gain the ability to **know more spells** than usual, and you can **prepare more spells** than your class level would normally allow. This makes you a more versatile and powerful caster.", "reference": "Spellcasting is the way a wizard uses a spellbook to learn and cast spells. At 1st level you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list and you have a spellbook that contains six 1st‑level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook holds all the wizard spells you know, except for cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n\nYou prepare spells from your spellbook each day. The number of spells you can prepare equals your Intelligence modifier plus your wizard level (at least one spell). The spells you prepare must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, a 3rd‑level wizard has four 1st‑level and two 2nd‑level slots; with an Intelligence of 16 you can prepare six 1st‑ or 2nd‑level spells. Once prepared, a spell can be cast using a slot of its level or higher, and casting it does not remove it from your prepared list. You can change your prepared list when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\nYou regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. To cast a spell you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher.\n\nYour spellcasting ability is Intelligence. Use your Intelligence modifier when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC, and when making an attack roll. The formulas are:\n- Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.\n- Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.\n\nIf a spell has the ritual tag and you have it in your spellbook, you can cast it as a ritual without needing to have it prepared.\n\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n\nEach time you gain a wizard level you may add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free; each must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You may also add other spells you find to your spellbook.\n\nArcane Recovery lets you recover expended spell slots once per day after a short rest. You can recover slots whose combined level is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the recovered slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, a 4th‑level wizard can recover up to two levels worth of slots, such as one 2nd‑level slot or two 1st‑level slots.\n\nAt 2nd level you choose an arcane tradition, which grants you features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

Arcane Traditions The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study. The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques. School of Evocation You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants. Evocation Savant Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved. Sculpt Spells Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. Potent Cantrip Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip. Empowered Evocation Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast. Overchannel Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. Your Spellbook The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. Copying a Spell into the Book.When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. Copying a Spell into the Book.When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book’s Appearance.

Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. Spellbook At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. Preparing and Casting Spells The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar). Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. Arcane Tradition When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Spell Mastery At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell", "<2-hop>\n\nand a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. Signature Spells When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. Arcane Traditions The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study. The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques. School of Evocation You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants. Evocation Savant Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved. Sculpt Spells Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. Potent Cantrip Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip. Empowered Evocation Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast. Overchannel Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. Your Spellbook The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.

With the Evocation Savant feature, this cost is reduced by half, meaning you only need to spend 12 gp and 1 hour of work to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook.\n\nIn terms of benefits for a wizard, especially in combat and spellcasting at higher levels, the Evocation school offers several advantages:\n\n1. **Powerful Evocation Spells**: Evocation wizards have access to a wide array of powerful spells that can deal significant damage, such as Fireball, Cone of Cold, and Meteor Shower. These spells are particularly effective for dealing with large groups of enemies or single powerful foes.\n\n2. **Scaling Damage**: As the wizard levels up, the damage from evocation spells increases, making them even more formidable at higher levels. This scaling ensures that evocation wizards remain relevant and impactful in combat.\n\n3. **Versatility in Combat**: Evocation spells can be used offensively and defensively. While primarily known for their destructive potential, some evocation spells can also be used to control the battlefield, such as creating barriers or slowing enemies.\n\n4. **Focus on Destruction**: Evocation wizards can specialize in dealing massive damage, which is especially useful in situations where the party needs to quickly eliminate threats.\n\n5. **Synergy with Other Classes and Features**: Evocation wizards can benefit from features like the Eldritch Blast cantrip or the use of spell scrolls, which can enhance their spellcasting capabilities.\n\nOverall, the Evocation school provides a powerful and straightforward approach to spellcasting, making it an excellent choice for wizards who want to focus on dealing damage and controlling the battlefield.", "reference": "The evokation savnt featur, which you gain when you pick the evokation scholl at 2nd level, halves the gold and tme you must spend to cop an evokation spel into your spellbokk.

At 2nd level you get sculpt spels, letting you choose 1 + the spell’s level of affected creatures to automatically succeed on their saves and take no damage if they would normally take half damage.
