{"user_input": "What does the blinded condition do?", "reference_contexts": ["Appendix PH -A: Conditions\nConditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster`s attack, or other effect. Mostconditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.  A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.  If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.  The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.\n\nBlinded\n•A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\nCharmed\n•A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.\n•The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.\n\nDeafened\n•A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.\n\nExhaustion\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long--term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.\nLevel Effect\n1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6\nDeathIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\n\nFrightened\n•A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\n•The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\n\nGrappled\n•A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and itcan’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n•The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated(see the condition).\n•The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grapple ror grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the\nthunder-wavespell.\n\nIncapacitated\n•An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.\n\nInvisible\n•Aninvisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.\n\nParalyzed\n•A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.\n•The creature automatically fails Strength andDexterity saving throws.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n•Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit ifthe attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.\n\nPetrified\n•A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Itsweight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.\n•The creature is incapacitated (see the condition),can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n•The creature automatically fails Strength andDexterity saving throws.\n•The creature has resistance to all damage.\n•The creature is immune to poison and disease,although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.\n\nPoisoned\n•A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\nProne\n•A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.\n•The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.\n•An attack roll against the creature has advantage ifthe attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.\n\nRestrained\n•A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and itcan’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.\n•The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.\n\nStunned\n•A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak onlyfalteringly.\n•The creature automatically fails Strength andDexterity saving throws.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n\nUnconscious\n•An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware ofits surroundings\n•The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.\n•The creature automatically fails Strength andDexterity saving throws.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n•Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit ifthe attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.\n\n\nAppendix PH -B: Fantasy -Historical Pantheons\nThe Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world’s ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.\n\nThe Celtic Pantheon\nIt’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.  The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.\n\nThe Greek Pantheon\nThe gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.\n\nThe Egyptian Pantheon\nThese gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at-the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe.\nThe Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.\n\nThe Norse Pantheon\nWhere the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring-this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.\nThe Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).\n\nCeltic Deities\nDeity

the\nplanes of existence. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.   Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.\n\nThe Material Plane\nThe Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.  The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.\n\nBeyond the Material\nBeyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.\n\nPlanar Travel\nWhen adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.\nTravel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.\nSpells. A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence.\nPlane shiftand\ngatecan transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision.\nEtherealnessallows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches-such as the Elemental Planes. And the\nastral projectionspell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.\n\nPortals.A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations-circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).\n\nTransitive Planes\nThe Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as\netherealnessand\nastral projectionallow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.\nThe\n\nEthereal Planeis a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the\nsee invisibility\nand true seeing spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as force cage and wall of force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.  The\nAstral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasionalbits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.\n\nInner Planes\nThe Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four\nElemental Planes-Air, Earth, Fire, and Water-form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning\nElemental Chaos.  At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.\n\nOuter Planes\nIf the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.   When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally “places” at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\nEven in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.\nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.\n\nOuter Planes\nThe planes with some element of good in their nature are called the\nUpper Planes. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the\nLower Planes. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.\n\nDemiplanes\nDemiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as\ndemiplane,or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that\nhas been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.\n\n\nAppendix MM- A: Miscellaneous Creatures\nThis appendix contains statistics for various animals, vermin, and other critters.

Mostconditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.  A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.  If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.  The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.\n\nBlinded\n•A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\n•Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\nCharmed\n•A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.\n•The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.\n\nDeafened\n•A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.\n\nExhaustion\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long--term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.\nLevel Effect\n1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6\nDeathIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\n\nFrightened\n•A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\n•The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\n\nGrappled\n•A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and itcan’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n•The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated(see the condition).\n•The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grapple ror grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the\nthunder-wavespell.\n\nIncapacitated\n•An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.\n\nInvisible\n•Aninvisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense.

They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.\n\nThe Celtic Pantheon\nIt’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.  The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.\n\nThe Greek Pantheon\nThe gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.\n\nThe Egyptian Pantheon\nThese gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at-the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe.\nThe Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.\n\nThe Norse Pantheon\nWhere the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring-this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.\nThe Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).\n\nCeltic Deities\nDeity

the\nplanes of existence. It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.   Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.\n\nThe Material Plane\nThe Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.  The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.\n\nBeyond the Material\nBeyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.\n\nPlanar Travel\nWhen adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.\nTravel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.\nSpells. A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence.\nPlane shiftand\ngatecan transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision.\nEtherealnessallows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches-such as the Elemental Planes. And the\nastral projectionspell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.\n\nPortals.A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations-circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).\n\nTransitive Planes\nThe Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as\netherealnessand\nastral projectionallow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.\nThe\n\nEthereal Planeis a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the\nsee invisibility\nand true seeing spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as force cage and wall of force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.  The\nAstral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasionalbits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.\n\nInner Planes\nThe Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four\nElemental Planes-Air, Earth, Fire, and Water-form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning\nElemental Chaos.  At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.\n\nOuter Planes\nIf the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.   When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally “places” at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\nEven in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.\nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.\n\nOuter Planes\nThe planes with some element of good in their nature are called the\nUpper Planes. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the\nLower Planes. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.\n\nDemiplanes\nDemiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as\ndemiplane,or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that\nhas been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.\n\n\nAppendix MM- A: Miscellaneous Creatures\nThis appendix contains statistics for various animals, vermin, and other critters.

{"user_input": "What does paralyzed creature do?", "reference_contexts": ["Appendix PH -A: Conditions Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster`s attack, or other effect. Mostconditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t. The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition. Blinded •A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. •Attack rolls against the creature have advantage,and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage. Charmed •A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. •The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature. Deafened •A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing. Exhaustion Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long--term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description. Level Effect 1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6 DeathIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description. A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks. An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1. Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Frightened •A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. •The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear. Grappled •A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and itcan’t benefit from any bonus to its speed. •The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated(see the condition). •The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grapple ror grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunder-wavespell. Incapacitated •An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions. Invisible •Aninvisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. •Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage. Paralyzed •A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak. •The creature automatically fails Strength andDexterity saving throws. •Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. •Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit ifthe attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Petrified •A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Itsweight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging. •The creature is incapacitated (see the condition),can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. •Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. •The creature automatically fails Strength andDexterity saving throws. •The creature has resistance to all damage. •The creature is immune to poison and disease,although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized. Poisoned •A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Prone •A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. •The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. •An attack roll against the creature has advantage ifthe attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

{"user_input": "What are the key characteristics of the Celtic Pantheon, including its origins, how it is used in gameplay, and a list of its main deities with their alignments, domains, and symbols?", "reference_contexts": ["Appendix PH -B: Fantasy -Historical Pantheons The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world’s ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game. The Celtic Pantheon It’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being. The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere. The Greek Pantheon The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too. The Egyptian Pantheon These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at-the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe. The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning. The Norse Pantheon Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring-this is the land of the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse. The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).

Its broad shoulders and deep, resonant growl command respect. While its eyes gleam with a calm, animalistic intelligence, its mind is devoted almost entirely to the hunt. The bear’s keen sense of smell can track prey across great distances, and its powerful claws are capable of rending logs and limbs alike. When a brown bear attacks, it moves with an unsettling swiftness, using its massive limbs to unleash a deadly multi‑attack that can sap even a well‑trained ranger’s stamina.\n\n---\n\n### Combat Actions  \n\n| Action | Attack | Bonus | Damage | Notes |\n|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Multiattack** | 2 claws | +5 | 6 (1d6 + 4) slashing each | Two attacks per round |\n| **Claw** |  |  | 6 (1d6 + 4) | — |\n| **Bite** |  |  | 7 (1d8 + 4) piercing | — |\n\n*(The bear’s “Keen Smell” trait gives it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, and it has advantage on any attack that relies on scent, such as a surprise attack against a creature that has not yet noticed it.)*\n\n---\n\n## Storyteller’s Guide: Using Keen Smell & Multi‑Attack in a Wilderness Encounter  \n\n1. **Set the Stage with Scent**  \n   * **Trail** – Drop a subtle scent trail (e.g., the faint smell of a wounded deer, or a campfire’s smoke). Allow the party to notice it early on a skill check (Survival + Perception).  \n   * **Ambush** – Have the bear detect the trail from a distance, giving the players a window to decide whether to investigate or keep moving. The bear’s keen smell can grant it advantage on a surprise attack if the party enters the bear’s territory without first noticing the scent.\n\n2. **Create Tension Through Movement**  \n   * **Ambush Tactics** – Describe the bear leaping from the underbrush, its massive paws crushing bark as it closes in. The players must react quickly; a missed reaction could let the bear use its first Multiattack before they can position themselves.\n   * **Environmental Hazards** – The bear’s sudden movement can scatter leaves, trip hikers, or crush a branch into a path. This adds a layer of danger beyond the bear’s attack rolls.\n\n3. **Use the Multi‑Attack to Amplify Fear**  \n   * **Overwhelming Force** – After the first claw strike, the bear often follows with a swift bite. Illustrate the roar of the bear and the crunch of flesh to convey how the creature can strike twice before the party can regain footing.  \n   * **Target Selection** – Encourage the bear to focus on the most vulnerable party members (e.g., a wounded ranger or a spellcaster whose concentration might be broken). The DM can narrate how the bear’s claws target a specific limb or the bite targets a throat, adding drama.\n\n4. **Provide a Moral Choice**  \n   * **Non‑combat Option** – Since the bear is a natural predator, give the party the option to try to flee, distract, or use the terrain to avoid the multi‑attack.  \n   * **Negotiation** – If the party has an animal companion or a druidic bond, they might attempt a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to pacify or redirect the bear, leveraging its natural fear of larger predators or its instinct to protect the young.\n\n5. **Conclude with a Lasting Impact**  \n   * **Scent Remains** – Even after the bear leaves, its lingering scent can haunt the party, making subsequent travel in the area more perilous.  \n   * **Reputation** – News of the encounter can spread among nearby villages, altering the local perception of the wilderness or prompting future adventures to hunt the “dangerous brown bear.”\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips for the DM  \n- **Use descriptive language** that emphasizes the bear’s smell (“a rich, earthy odor rolls across the wind”) to keep the scent mechanic vivid.  \n- **Let the players’ Survival/Perception checks feel meaningful**; a success can give them a chance to set up a defensive position or plan an escape route.  \n- **Balance the Multiattack** by ensuring the bear’s damage isn’t trivial—each hit should feel threatening, especially to a party lacking heavy armor or ranged options.\n\nWith these elements, the brown bear becomes more than a stat block; it becomes a memorable, scent‑driven adversary that tests both the party’s combat skill and their ability to read the wild’s subtle cues.", "reference": "The Brown Bear is a large beast that is unaligned.

(It doesn’t have to use the full 30 ft.) The destination must be a space the dog can see and must be unoccupied. The teleport is instantaneous; it does **not** provoke opportunity attacks and it doesn’t count as an attack. |\n| **Bite** | A melee attack that can be made after the teleport (or before, if you choose). | The dog’s Bite attack is a separate Attack action. It deals **1d4 + 2** piercing damage and has a reach of 5 ft. The dog can only bite once per Attack action (unless it has extra attacks). |\n\n### What happens during a turn?\n\n1. **Movement** – The dog may move up to its speed (40 ft.).  \n   *If the dog moves more than 30 ft.*, it can teleport the rest of its movement, up to 30 ft.  \n   *If the dog moves less than 30 ft.*, it may still teleport a portion of that movement, as long as the total teleport distance doesn’t exceed 30 ft.  \n\n2. **Teleport** – The teleport is part of the movement, not an action. The dog simply appears in the new space.\n\n3. **Attack** – After moving/teleporting, the dog can use its Attack action to bite (or any other attack it has, e.g., if you granted it extra attacks).  \n\n4. **Other actions** – The dog can perform any other actions allowed (e.g., if you gave it a bonus action attack or a special effect).\n\n### Can it bite *before* teleporting?\n\nYes. The dog could move a short distance (or none), then bite, and then teleport (if it has remaining movement). However, the teleport itself cannot be used as a bite; the bite is always a separate action.\n\n### Can it bite *after* teleporting?\n\nYes. Once the dog has finished its movement and teleport, it can still use its Attack action to bite, provided it ends its movement adjacent to a creature (or uses the bite’s 5‑ft reach).\n\n### Summary\n\n- The dog can teleport up to **30 ft** each turn as part of its movement.  \n- The teleport is instantaneous and does not count as an attack.  \n- The dog can bite **before or after** teleporting, but the bite is always part of its Attack action (not part of the teleport).  \n\nFeel free to let me know if you’re using a different edition or have a specific scenario in mind!", "reference": "The Blink Dog can teleport up to 40 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, carrying any equipment it is wearing or carrying, and it can make one bite attack before or after teleporting.", "answer_relevancy": 0.5526934116823982, "semantic_similarity": 0.47094702893286894, "bleu_score": 0.023725516345643967, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.0995850622406639, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.053691275167785234, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.6857142857142857}

The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution save or be poisoned (DC 13, 1 minute). |\n| • **Web Attack** | Ranged 20 ft./25 ft. (proficiency bonus). The spider can cover a 20‑ft. square in web. Each creature in the web must succeed on a DC 11 Strength save or be restrained (escape 5 ft. each round). Webs are ignored by the spider for movement and can be torn down with an action. |\n\n#### Typical Tactics\n1. **Ambush** – Giant spiders wait in or near webs, striking from the shadows.  \n2. **Web‑First** – On the first round they often spread a web to trap the party, then use their bite attack to finish off restrained foes.  \n3. **Mobility** – With a climb speed, they can escape, reposition, or attack from ceilings.  \n4. **Group Coordination** – In packs they can swarm, using webs to separate the party and then bite.  \n5. **Poison Focus** – Their bite’s poison can be a big threat to PCs that have low Con or are already wounded.\n\n#### Encounter Tips for the DM\n- **Use terrain** – Place webs near chokepoints, stairs, or in cavern ceilings.  \n- **Vary tactics** – Mix solo spidies with a few that form a web network.  \n- **Add stakes** – If the party is in a ruined building, the spider’s webs can trap the entire floor.  \n- **Reward careful players** – A creature with a web attack that can be destroyed with a fire‑based attack or a successful Dexterity check (e.g., a rope to pull down the web) gives players tactical choices.\n\n#### Quick Summary\nGiant spiders are stealthy, web‑based ambushers that use their bite’s poison to incapacitate foes. They are most dangerous in groups, using webs to restrain and then bite, and can climb walls and ceilings to change the battlefield. In a 5e encounter, they’re a solid challenge for 1–3 level‑3 characters.", "reference": "A Giant Spider is a Large beast that lives underground, building its lair on ceilings or in dark, web‑filled crevices. It can climb difficult surfaces, including upside‑down on ceilings, without needing an ability check. The spider spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands from its abdomen, using them to snare prey. When it attacks, it bites with a +5 to hit, dealing 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage and forcing a DC 11 Constitution saving throw; on a failed save the target takes 9 (2d8) poison damage. If the poison reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour and is paralyzed while poisoned. The spider can also fire a web as a ranged attack (range 30/60 ft.) that restrains the target; the restrained creature can attempt a DC 12 Strength check to burst the web. The webbing itself has AC 10, 5 hit points, is vulnerable to fire damage, and is immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. The Giant Spider’s lair is often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims, making it a foreboding, sticky trap for any who dare enter its underground domain.", "answer_relevancy": 0.6794691917250554, "semantic_similarity": 0.38788777801547525, "bleu_score": 0.014711591431728283, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.16485225505443235, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.1185682326621924, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.27040816326530615}

It rarely charges—most of its energy is spent in pursuit or in ambush.  \n- **Tactics for Low‑Level Parties:**  \n  1. **Ambush from the Depths** – the shark can appear from a submerged cavern or a hidden trench.  \n  2. **Chase & Bait** – it can chase a wounded target until the party’s spellcasters or rangers can finish it off.  \n  3. **Harassment** – a single bite can be enough to reduce a party’s hit points; keep the shark at a distance if you’re under‑powered.  \n\n---\n\n### Breathing & Environment\n\n- **Water Breathing:** The shark can stay underwater indefinitely; it does not need to surface for air.  \n- **Preferred Habitat:** Deep sea, shallow coastal waters, and large rivers where it can stalk fish or small sea‑folk.\n\n---\n\n### Challenge Rating & Scaling\n\n- **CR ½** – appropriate for a low‑level encounter (levels 1–2).  \n- **Scaling Up:**  \n  - **Great White Shark (CR 3)** is a step up, with a 2d10 + 3 bite.  \n  - **Giant Shark (3.5 e, CR 3)** has 2d10 + 3 bite and a “Giant” special ability (e.g., “Swallow Small Creature”).  \n  - For a higher‑level threat, add actions such as a “Rake” (1d4 + 2) or a “Bite” that deals extra damage to a stunned target.\n\n---\n\n### Using a Giant Shark in Your Campaign\n\n| Scenario | Why It Works |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Sea‑Travel Hazard** | Random encounter on a voyage; adds danger to naval settings. |\n| **Underwater Dungeon** | Guards a submerged cavern or treasure hoard; can be a boss or a minion. |\n| **Fisherman’s Legend** | NPCs warn of a “giant shark” that preys on fishermen; can inspire quests to find its lair. |\n| **Mount/Companion** | In a world of merfolk or aquatic rangers, a trained shark could serve as a mount. |\n| **Environmental Puzzle** | The party must out‑maneuver a shark to reach a submerged portal. |\n| **Story Hook** | The party is hired to hunt the shark that has been attacking a nearby fishing village. |\n\n**Creative Twist Ideas**\n\n- **Corrupted Giant Shark:** After a necromancer’s spell, it gains a *Paralyzing Bite* (adds a short‑duration paralysis).  \n- **Shark‑Infested Ruins:** The ruins are protected by a swarm of small sharks; the Giant Shark is their leader.  \n- **Shark‑Mimicry:** A lycanthropic NPC can transform into a giant shark, allowing a stealthy underwater approach.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** The 5 e Giant Shark is a straightforward, low‑CR water predator that uses a single bite attack and simple tactics. It’s ideal for early‑level sea or underwater encounters, and it can be expanded or tweaked to fit higher‑level stories. If you need a stronger version, swap in the Great White Shark or a 3.5 e Giant Shark with more damage and a few extra actions.", "reference": "The giant shark is a huge beast, unaligned, with an armor class of 13 (natural armor) and 126 hit points (11d12 + 55).

These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.\n\nCustomizing NPCs\nThere are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.\nRacial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the Player’s Handbook.\nSpell Swaps. One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s challenge rating.\nArmor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC’s challenge rating.\nMagic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.\n\nAcolyte\nMedium humanoid (any race), any alignment\nArmor Class 10\nHit Points 9 (2d8)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT      WIS      CHA      \n10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  14 (+2)  11 (+0)  \n\nSkills Medicine +4, Religion +2\nSenses passive Perception 12\nLanguagesany one language (usually Common)\nChallenge1/4 (50 XP)\nSpellcasting.The acolyte is a 1st--level spellcaster.

These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.\n\nCustomizing NPCs\nThere are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.\nRacial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the Player’s Handbook.\nSpell Swaps. One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s challenge rating.\nArmor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC’s challenge rating.\nMagic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.\n\nAcolyte\nMedium humanoid (any race), any alignment\nArmor Class 10\nHit Points 9 (2d8)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT      WIS      CHA      \n10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  10 (+0)  14 (+2)  11 (+0)  \n\nSkills Medicine +4, Religion +2\nSenses passive Perception 12\nLanguagesany one language (usually Common)\nChallenge1/4 (50 XP)\nSpellcasting.The acolyte is a 1st--level spellcaster.

To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.\nMore than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy.

The rider’s Attack action can be used to strike from the warhorse’s hooves. |\n| **Charge** | Move 20 ft. (or more) and attack with hooves.  If it hits, Trample activates. | Charge deals the normal damage **plus the Trample damage**.  The target is knocked prone on a failed Strength save, giving advantage to the rider’s next attack. |\n| **Stand‑alone** | The warhorse can fight on its own, making a Hooves attack every turn. | Useful for an NPC rider who wants to use the warhorse’s attack without the rider’s intervention. |\n| **Defensive support** | The warhorse can use its high speed to keep distance or to block enemies. | If a creature tries to attack the rider, the warhorse can be commanded to use its natural armor and Hooves to deflect. |\n\n### Combat Flow Example\n\n1. **Action** – The rider orders the warhorse to charge.  \n2. **Movement** – The warhorse moves 20 ft. toward the target.  \n3. **Attack** – The warhorse makes its Hooves attack.  \n   * If the attack hits:  \n     * The target must make a DC 13 Strength save or be knocked prone.  \n     * The target takes 1d6 bludgeoning (Trample).  \n     * The rider now has an opportunity to strike a prone enemy with advantage.  \n4. **Bonus Action** – The rider can use *Dash* or *Help* to aid allies.  \n5. **Reposition** – The warhorse may use its high speed to keep its distance or to attack another target on a subsequent turn.\n\n---\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n1. **Warhorse is a simple creature**—no spellcasting or complex tactics.  \n2. **Trample** is its only special feature; it is effectively a built‑in Charge bonus.  \n3. **Hooves** attack is the primary way to damage enemies.  \n4. **Mounting rules** let a character use the warhorse’s attacks while riding it.  \n5. **Speed 50 ft.** makes it a great scout or a fast line‑breaker in melee.  \n\nThat’s the essence of a warhorse in D&D 5e—quick, sturdy, and with one potent ability that turns a normal charge into a potentially devastating trample.

If a creature is hit, it takes that damage. Because the swarm is a group of rats, the attack damage is the same regardless of how many rats hit the target. |\n\n### How the Swarm Acts in the Story\n\n1. **Movement & Navigation**  \n   - The swarm behaves like a living wall of teeth. It slides through cracks, over debris, and can even crawl up narrow vertical shafts.  \n   - It follows scent strongly. A lingering trail of food, blood, or a wounded creature’s scent can pull the swarm through a door, across a courtyard, or into a dungeon corridor.  \n   - When a creature blocks the swarm’s path, the rats will try to climb over it (they have a climb speed) or split to squeeze through a gap as far as 1 ft. wide. They will not try to open doors or manipulate objects unless a small item falls into their reach.  \n\n2. **Interaction With Other Creatures**  \n   - **Single Target** – A lone rat will bite repeatedly, the swarm’s attack rolls benefit from the “Swarm” trait. The damage is modest (1d4 + 2), but the swarm can bite every round, dealing cumulative damage to a creature that is not large or larger.  \n   - **Groups** – If several adventurers are bunched together, the swarm can occupy the same square as all of them simultaneously. Each hit will deal 1d4 + 2 to every creature in the space. In practice, a swarm can shred a small party in a few rounds.  \n   - **Large Creatures** – The swarm can’t be targeted by attacks that only hit a single large or bigger creature, so a giant, dragon, or a group of large beasts will be relatively safe unless the DM rules the rats as a nuisance.  \n   - **Barriers** – The swarm can be stopped by a sturdy wall or a barricade; it simply dissolves at the edge. It can’t go through solid stone or a locked door unless there is a crack or the door is ajar.  \n\n3. **Special Abilities & Role‑Playing Notes**  \n   - **Keen Smell** – Use this to set up a chase scene: a scent of a fallen party member’s blood pulls the swarm. A DM might give a bonus to the rats’ Perception checks when they’re following a scent.  \n   - **Disease (DMG optional)** – The *Dungeon Master’s Guide* lists a “Swarm of Rats” disease as a possible hazard. The DM may choose to have each rat carry a minor illness (e.g., a plague, rabies). A creature that takes bite damage could be forced to succeed on a DC 12 Con save or become infected, taking 1d4 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns for a few rounds.  \n   - **Nuisance/Deception** – In a story, the swarm could act as a “living trap.” It might swarm into a room to guard a hidden cache, or it could be used by a villain to keep a creature in check while the villain works elsewhere.  \n   - **Tactical Use** – Swarms can be employed as a “swarm cover.” A creature could hide behind a wall of rats to avoid attacks; the rats will bite anyone who tries to pass.  \n\n### Sample Narrative\n\n> “The air grew thin and the hiss of dozens of tiny jaws filled the corridor. A wall of teeth and wet, black snouts pressed against the stone walls, the rats moving in a single, undulating mass. Their keen smell guided them, following the faint scent of the lost wanderer’s blood as they pushed past the cracked door, their tiny bodies slipping through a 1‑ft gap that the old adventurer had missed.”  \n\n> As the party stepped into the corridor, the swarm licked the floor in front of them. The rats split, their mouths snapping, and the first few bite marks appeared on the adventurer’s arm. They could feel the bite sting and the tiny claws digging, each rat adding to the wound in a maddening, almost musical rhythm.  \n\n> A DM might let the party roll a DC 12 Constitution save or begin to take 1d4 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns for the next few rounds, hinting that the rats have carried a disease.  \n\n### Quick “How‑to” for a DM\n\n1. **Setup** – Place the swarm in a tight area that can be entered by scent.  \n2. **Movement** – Let the swarm move as a single creature. Use a 10 ft. grid for its “speed.”  \n3. **Attack** – Roll +4 to hit. On a hit, deal 1d4 + 2 piercing damage. If a creature is in the swarm’s space, all creatures in the space take the damage (if the DM wants).  \n4. **Disease (optional)** – If you want to add a disease, have each creature that takes damage roll a DC 12 Con save or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage each round for 3 rounds.  \n5. **Role‑play** – Emphasize the chaotic, almost hypnotic movement of the swarm, the constant biting, and the overwhelming numbers.  \n\n### Bottom Line\n\nA Swarm of Rats is a low‑CR nuisance that can still threaten a party if it’s left unchecked. They’re fast, hard to stop, and can deliver damage to many creatures at once. Use their keen smell and swarm nature to create tense chase scenes or to guard a secret, and sprinkle a little disease for an extra layer of danger. With these tools, you can weave a memorable encounter that feels alive and threatening, even for a small party.", "reference": "The Swarm of Rats is a medium swarm of Tiny beasts, unaligned.

{"user_input": "What hapens if a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway?", "reference_contexts": ["Space A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them. A creature’sspace also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one. Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one. Squeezing into a Smaller Space A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space. Actions in Combat When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure. Attack The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists. With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “"], "response": "**Short answer:**  \nA Medium hobgoblin can occupy a 5‑ft‑wide doorway without issue—he simply takes up that 5‑ft square. While he’s in that square he blocks the doorway for other Medium or larger creatures (unless they’re willing to share the space or can force him out). If the door itself is closed, the hobgoblin must open or break it before he can move through it; if it’s open, he can walk in and out as part of his movement.\n\n---\n\n### Why that’s true\n\n| Rule | What it says | How it applies |\n|------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Creature size & space** (PHB 197) | A Medium creature occupies a 5‑ft × 5‑ft square. | A 5‑ft‑wide doorway is exactly that size, so a Medium creature can stand in it. |\n| **Sharing a square** (PHB 197) | Two creatures can share a space if they’re the same size or the other is willing; otherwise one must move out or grapple. | The hobgoblin standing in the doorway blocks the square. Other Medium or larger creatures would need to grapple or be willing to share the space. |\n| **Doorways and passage** (DMG 276) | A doorway that’s at least as wide as a creature’s space can be passed through normally if the doorway is open. A closed door is a barrier. | If the door is open, the hobgoblin can move out of the doorway as part of his movement. If closed, he must open or break it before he can pass. |\n| **Moving through a doorway** (PHB 190) | You can move through a doorway as long as it fits your size. | The hobgoblin can move in or out of the doorway because it’s exactly 5 ft wide. |\n\n### Practical implications\n\n- **Blocking passage:** While the hobgoblin occupies the doorway, it’s effectively a “wall” for other Medium or larger creatures. They can’t step into that square unless they’re willing or they grapple the hobgoblin.\n- **Moving out:** He can use any part of his movement to step out of the doorway normally. If he’s trying to go through a closed door, he must open it first (a standard action unless he has a shortcut, like a *bypass* feat or a spell that opens doors).\n- **Being stuck:** The hobgoblin isn’t “stuck” in the doorway by virtue of standing in it. The only restriction is that he can’t pass through the doorway until he’s moved out of the square or the door is opened.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** A Medium hobgoblin standing in a 5‑ft‑wide doorway takes up that space, blocks it for others, and can move in or out of it normally (assuming the door is open or he opens it). There are no special restrictions beyond the usual rules about size, space, and moving through doors.", "reference": "If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

{"user_input": "What effect does taking the Dodge action have on attacks against you?", "reference_contexts": ["Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks. Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action. Cast a Spell Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. Dash When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash. Disengage If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. Dodge When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix PH-A) or if your speed drops to 0. Help You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage. Hide When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section. Ready Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn. First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.” When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round. When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken. Search When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check. Use an Object You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn. Making an Attack Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure. 1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack’srange: a creature, an object, or a location. 2. Determine modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target.In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll. 3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead ofdamage.If there’s ever any question whether somethingyou’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack."], "response": "When you use the **Dodge** action (PHB p. 190) you spend your action focusing on evading attacks.

{"user_input": "How does the d20 function in determining attack outcomes during combat, and what special results can it produce?", "reference_contexts": ["Attack Rolls When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block. Modifiersto the Roll When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block. Ability Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule. Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster. Proficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell. Rolling 1 or 20 Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. Unseen Attackers and Targets Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness. When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target’s location correctly. When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden-both unseen and unheard-when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses. Ranged Attacks When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack. Range You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range. Ranged Attacks in Close Combat Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated. Melee Attacks Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack. Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions. Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 +your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Opportunity Attacks In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack. You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach. You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy. Two-Weapon Fighting When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it. Grappling When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple.

The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required). Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape.

If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you. Cover Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover. A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend. A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk. A target with total covercan’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle."], "response": "**Cover – PHB**  \n*(Combat section, “Cover”, PHB p. 190)*\n\n> *“Cover: A creature has a +2 bonus to its AC and Dexterity saving throws against an attack that targets it if it has **partial cover** from a creature or object. The creature has a +5 bonus if it has **full cover**.”*\n\n**Low‑wall rule – DMG**  \n*(Defensive positions, “Low Walls”, DMG p. 252)*\n\n> *“A low wall that is less than half the height of a character provides no cover.”*\n\n### How it applies to a portcullis, tree trunk, and low wall\n\n| Obstacle | Typical state | Cover granted | How the rule applies |\n|----------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| **Portcullis** (lowered) | A lowered metal gate blocks line of sight | Partial cover (+2) if it blocks at least part of the target’s view; full cover (+5) if it blocks the entire view | Apply the PHB cover rule. A portcullis is simply an object that can provide cover. |\n| **Portcullis** (raised) | Open, no obstruction | None | No cover, because there is no object blocking line of sight. |\n| **Tree trunk** | A solid trunk or large branch | Partial cover (+2) if it blocks part of the target’s view; full cover (+5) if it blocks all of it | Same PHB cover rule; trees are treated like any other solid object. |\n| **Low wall** (≤½ character height) | Short wall | No cover | DMG rule explicitly states that such a wall gives no cover. |\n| **High wall** (>½ character height) | Tall wall | Partial or full cover depending on how much of the target’s view it blocks | Use PHB cover rule; the wall’s height matters only to determine whether it can block the view. |\n\n**Bottom line:** A portcullis is treated like any other object that can block an attacker's line of sight. Lowered, it gives the normal +2 partial‑cover bonus (or +5 full cover if it blocks the target completely). Raised, it gives no cover. The same rules apply to a tree trunk or any other obstacle. Only the DMG’s explicit statement about low walls provides a special case where a short wall gives *no* cover.", "reference": "A portcullis is an obstacle that gives a target three‑quarters cover, which provides a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws.", "answer_relevancy": 0.622185010410191, "semantic_similarity": 0.4484198215638977, "bleu_score": 0.08672458482354163, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.061452513966480445, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.03283582089552239, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.4782608695652174}
{"user_input": "In a fantasy campaign setting, how can I weave the concept of Healing into my narrative to enrich lore, add flavor, and creatively use the rules around hit points and damage, while staying true to the mechanics described in the context?", "reference_contexts": ["Damage and Healing Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireballspell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures. Hit Points Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile. A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing. Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points. Damage Rolls Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage. When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier-the same modifier used for the attack roll-to the damage. A spelltells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one targetat the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireballor a cleric casts flame strike, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast. Critical Hits When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once. For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well. Targets A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below). Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise. A Clear Path to the Target To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover. If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction. Targeting Yourself If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself."], "response": "### 1. Ground Healing in the World’s Lore  \n\n| Element | How to Implement | Mechanical Tie‑in |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **Ancient Traditions** | Create a *healing guild* that traces its lineage to an old deity of restoration (e.g., Eilistraee, Ilmater). Their rites are performed only on *holy days* or after a *blood moon*. | When the DM calls for a “holy rite,” the party can spend **1 hour** of preparation time. The DM might give a *DC 15 Insight* check to discover the proper steps; a success grants a *bonus* on the next healing spell or ability. |\n| **Natural Curatives** | Introduce plants, fungi, or crystals that restore health over time. The DM can treat the “healing over time” effect as an *ongoing 1d8 HP per day* while the creature consumes the herb. | The party can spend an *action* each day to apply the herb; if they use the **Herbalism Kit** skill, they might *roll a DC 13 Medicine check* to increase the heal by +1d8. |\n| **Cursed Remedies** | Provide “healing potions” that are laced with a curse that activates when the party heals too often or in the wrong place. | The potion restores *3d4+3 HP*, but triggers a *DC 12 Perception check* to spot a “glimmer of rot.” A failed check adds a *-1 penalty* to the next healing action. |\n| **Living Beings** | Let NPCs (e.g., a friendly healer, a druid, or a sentient tree) be *sources* of healing. The DM can allow a *role‑playing conversation* to determine the amount healed: *“I will heal you to the point where you can stand again, but not to 100% unless you show me your true intentions.”* | The NPC can provide *healing touch* equal to the *DM’s discretion* (e.g., 2d8+2 HP). If the party proves devotion, the heal could be *2d8+4* instead. |\n\n### 2. Use Hit Points & Damage Creatively\n\n| Mechanic | Narrative Hook | Example |\n|----------|----------------|---------|\n| **Hit Point Pools** | Treat the party’s HP as a *shared resource* that can be “redistributed.” | A spell like *Mass Healing Word* can be flavored as “the divine light spreads through the camp, giving everyone a fresh 3 HP.” |\n| **Damage Types** | Differentiate damage (bludgeoning, fire, psychic) with *distinct healing* methods. | Fire wounds can be soothed with *salt and water* potions (restore 1d6 HP), while psychic wounds need *meditation* (restoration over 1 round). |\n| **Damage Buffers** | Introduce objects that temporarily reduce damage, like a *shield of light* that absorbs 2 points per hit. | A DM can declare “The shield glows brighter, absorbing 2 points of all damage.” That effectively *reduces the damage roll before subtracting from HP*. |\n| **Bleed / Ongoing Damage** | Let bleeding be “the wound keeps itself open,” requiring *sealing* over multiple rounds. | A wounded NPC could have *Bleed 1* until the party uses a *Healing Kit* or spends a turn *bandaging* (Medicine check). |\n\n### 3. Flavor‑Rich Healing Actions\n\n| Action | How to Play | Rule Reference |\n|--------|-------------|----------------|\n| **Sacred Chant** | A bard or cleric sings a *chant* that heals allies. The DM can treat this as a *1‑minute spellcasting* with *DC 13 Charisma check* to reach the chorus. | *Cleric spellcasting (e.g., Healing Word, Cure Wounds)*. |\n| **Blood Offer** | A character sacrifices a portion of their own HP (e.g., *1d6+3* to a dying companion). | The DM can interpret this as a *self‑harm* that grants the target a heal equal to the sacrifice, *no spellcasting time*. |\n| **Ritual of Renewal** | A multi‑hour ritual that “replaces” HP rather than adds. The DM can allow the party to *regain 50% of missing HP* after 4 hours, but each day the ritual requires a *new DC 15 Medicine or Religion check*. | *Rituals* in the PHB. |\n| **Living Healer** | An NPC who “feeds” on the party’s fatigue, restoring HP as long as they *rest* together. | DMG *Feats* like *Tough* or *Resilient* can be mirrored. |\n\n### 4. Maintaining Rule Integrity\n\n1. **Use the official HP and damage system.** All healing must ultimately be expressed as adding HP to a creature’s total up to the maximum.  \n2. **Spellcasting times, components, and prerequisites remain**. For example, if you want a “Healing Word” style effect without a verbal component, it becomes a *“Cantrip – Touch”* only if the class allows it.  \n3. **Check DCs should match the difficulty** you’re aiming for. For rare or powerful healing, raise the DC; for mundane first aid, lower it.  \n4. **Track resources**—if a healer can use a special herb a certain number of times per day, keep a log.  \n5. **Let the DM adjudicate** when narrative choices influence mechanics. For instance, a heartfelt plea could give a +2 bonus on the next healing roll.\n\n### 5. Quick Reference Cheat Sheet\n\n| Feature | Flavor | Rules |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| Healing Potion | “Brewed in the ancient elixir‑kiln.” | 3d4+3 HP, one per day |\n| Healing Touch | “The healer’s palms glow.” | Touch spell, DC 13 Wisdom |\n| Natural Cure | “Salvage the mistweed.” | Medicine check, 1d8+1 HP |\n| Healing Ritual | “Four nights of chanting.” | 4‑hour, 50% missing HP |\n| Healing Curse | “The cure costs a fragment of life.” | Add 1d4 HP, subtract same from healer |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Weave healing into your story by giving it a distinct cultural or magical origin, tying it to specific lore (gods, rituals, flora), and then letting the narrative influence how, when, and how much HP is restored. Keep all HP modifications bounded by the core rules—add or subtract within the max, observe spellcasting times and components, and let the DM adjudicate the flavor‑driven effects. This approach enriches lore, adds flavor, and preserves the integrity of D&D mechanics.", "reference": "Healing restores a creature’s current hit points, which represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck.

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor: •You have advantage on Strength checks andStrength saving throws. •When you make a melee weapon attack usingStrength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of theBarbarian table. •You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging. Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. Unarmored Defense While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. Reckless Attack Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. Danger Sense At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. Primal Path At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Fast Movement Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor. Feral Instinct By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. Brutal Critical Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. Relentless Rage Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. Persistent Rage Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. Indomitable Might Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. Primal Champion At 20th level, you embody the power ofthe wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24. Path of the Berserker For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end-that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood.

The attack is made **after** the triggering attack has resolved but before the damage from that attack is applied. | • Only one reaction per round.  <br>• You can’t use it if you’re incapacitated, beyond 30 ft., or can’t see the attacker. <br>• The reaction can be used even if the hit was from a ranged attack or a spell. <br>• If you have another feature that also uses a reaction (e.g., *Uncanny Dodge*, *Intimidating Presence*), you must pick one for the round. <br>• If you have *Rage* (barbarian) you gain advantage on Strength checks and saves, but it doesn’t automatically give extra damage to this strike unless you have *Savage Attacker* to re‑roll dice. <br>• If you’re a paladin, you can add radiant damage via *Divine Smite* to the strike, just like any other melee attack. |\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n1. **Level Needed** – 7th‑level Paladin, Oath of Vengeance.  \n2. **Trigger** – You’re hit by an attack; you can see the attacker; the attacker is within 30 ft.  \n3. **Reaction** – “Make a melee‑weapon attack against that creature.”  \n4. **Damage** – Normal weapon damage + modifiers. Add *Divine Smite* if you choose.  \n5. **Attack Type** – Melee weapon attack.  \n6. **Once per Round** – One reaction per round.  \n7. **Interactions**  \n   * *Mindless Rage* (a barbarian feat that negates mind effects while raging) does **not** affect this feature.  \n   * *Intimidating Presence* (or any other reaction) – you can use only one reaction per round.  \n   * *Savage Attacker* – you can re‑roll the weapon’s damage dice once per turn (but only once, regardless of how many attacks you make).  \n\n**Example**  \nYour paladin is hit by a goblin’s rapier swing. Immediately after the hit is confirmed, the paladin uses the *Retaliative Strike* reaction to swing their longsword at the goblin. They roll a d8 (longsword damage) + Strength mod + any other bonuses. If it lands, the goblin takes that damage. The paladin then cannot use any other reaction this round unless the goblin misses and the paladin’s *Uncanny Dodge* triggers, etc.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you’re using a different class, home‑brew feature, or have other questions about combining this with other abilities!", "reference": "Retaliation is a feature that starts at 14th level.

Bonus Proficiencies When you join"], "response": "**Song of Rest**  \n*Class:* Bard  \n*Level:* 3rd (PHB, p. 53)  \n\n---\n\n### 1. What is it?\n\nA special bardic ability that lets allies add extra hit points whenever they spend hit dice during a *short rest*. It is **not** a spell, nor does it require the bard to spend any resources.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How does it help during a short rest?\n\nWhen a creature that can hear the bard spends a hit die to regain hit points, that creature can roll an extra die (the “bardic‑inspiration die”) and add the result to the hit points it has just regained. The feature can trigger **any number of times** during the short rest – every time a creature spends a hit die and is able to hear the bard.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Hit‑point bonus by bard level\n\n| Bard level | Size of the extra die |\n|------------|-----------------------|\n| 3rd‑4th    | d6 |\n| 5th‑8th    | d8 |\n| 9th‑12th   | d10 |\n| 13th‑20th  | d12 |\n\nSo at 3rd level the bonus is 1–6 HP, at 5th level 1–8 HP, and so on.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Difference from Bardic Inspiration\n\n| Feature | What it gives | When it can be used |\n|---------|---------------|---------------------|\n| **Bardic Inspiration** | A die (d6 → d8 → d10 → d12) that an ally can add to an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. | Any time an ally can hear the bard (not tied to a rest). |\n| **Song of Rest** | An extra die added to hit points gained from spending hit dice during a short rest. | Only during short rests, and only when a creature spends a hit die. |\n\nSong of Rest **does not** require a Bardic Inspiration die to be expended; the bard can roll the die freely each time the trigger occurs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Can other classes use it?\n\nNo. It is a **bard class feature** (no subclass prerequisite).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Exact wording (PHB, p. 53)\n\n> **Song of Rest**  \n> When you or a creature that can hear you regains hit points by spending hit dice during a short rest, that creature can roll a bardic inspiration die and add it to the hit points regained. The die you roll is a d6 at 3rd level. The die increases to a d8 at 5th level, to a d10 at 9th level, and to a d12 at 13th level.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Does it require the bard to spend hit dice?\n\nNo. The bard does **not** need to spend any hit dice or any other resource to use the feature. It simply allows an ally to roll an extra die whenever they spend a hit die during the short rest.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Can the bard help allies who are *not* healing?\n\nNo. The effect is tied specifically to the moment a creature *spends a hit die to regain hit points*. It does not apply to other kinds of healing (e.g., spells) or to non‑healing benefits.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Prerequisites\n\n- **Class:** Bard  \n- **Level:** 3rd (no subclass requirement)\n\n---\n\n### 10. Interaction with other bard features\n\n| Feature | Interaction |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Countercharm** | No effect. Countercharm provides a bonus to saving throws, not to hit points. |\n| **Magical Secrets** | No effect. Magical Secrets lets you learn extra spells, not affect Song of Rest. |\n| **Bardic Inspiration** | The die used for Song of Rest is the same die size that Bardic Inspiration uses, but it is rolled independently and does **not** consume an inspiration die. |\n\n---\n\n### 11. Applies to all friendly creatures who can hear the bard?\n\nYes. *Any* creature that can hear the bard and is spending hit dice during a short rest can benefit. There is no limit on how many creatures can benefit in a single short rest.\n\n---\n\n### 12. How many times per short rest?\n\nUnlimited, as many times as the trigger occurs. If, for example, three different allies each spend a hit die during the same short rest, each of them can roll the extra die.\n\n---\n\n### 13. Limit on number of creatures that can benefit\n\nNo explicit limit. The only restrictions are that the creature must be able to hear the bard and must be spending a hit die during the short rest.\n\n---\n\n### 14. Difference between the d6, d8, d10, and d12 versions\n\nThe difference is purely the size of the extra die added to healing:\n\n- **d6** → 1–6 HP\n- **d8** → 1–8 HP\n- **d10** → 1–10 HP\n- **d12** → 1–12 HP\n\nThe progression is tied to the bard’s level as shown in the table above.\n\n---\n\n### 15. How the feature scales with level\n\nThe die size scales at the following levels: 3, 5, 9, 13. After 13th level it stays at d12 for the rest of the game.\n\n---\n\n### 16.

Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. Cantrips You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table. Spell Slots The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.

Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Ritual Casting You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. Spellcasting Focus You can use a musical instrument (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. Bardic Inspiration You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. Jack of All Trades Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level. Expertise At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Font of Inspiration Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest. Countercharm At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). Magical Secrets By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table. You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level. Superior Inspiration At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use. College of Lore Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic. The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another.

The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being. Frenzy Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix PH-A). Mindless Rage Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage. Intimidating Presence Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours. Retaliation Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.  Class Features As a barbarian, you gain the following class features. Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d12 per barbarian level Hit Points at 1st Level: 12 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per barbarian level after 1st the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice. Cutting Words Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed. Additional Magical Secrets At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know. Peerless Skill Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.", "<2-hop>\n\nspell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Ritual Casting You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. Spellcasting Focus You can use a musical instrument (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. Bardic Inspiration You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. Jack of All Trades Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus. Song of Rest Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level. Bard College At 3rd level, you delve intothe advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice, such as the College of Lore. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level. Expertise At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Font of Inspiration Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest. Countercharm At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). Magical Secrets By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table. You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level. Superior Inspiration At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use. College of Lore Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic. The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

{"user_input": "Calc passiv checks?", "reference_contexts": ["Passive Checks\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\nHere’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a\nscore.\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.  The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.\n\nWorking Together\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.  A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\n\nGroup Checks\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.  To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.  Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\n\nUsing Each Ability\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\n\nStrength\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\n\nStrength Checks\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\nAthletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:\n•You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff,avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.\n•You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.\n•You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\nOther Strength Checks. The GM might also call fora Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door\n•Break free of bonds\n•Push through a tunnel that is too small\n•Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it\n•Tip over a statue\n•Keep a boulder from rolling\n\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\n\nLifting and Carrying\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\n\nCarrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength\nscore multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough\nthat most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.\nPush, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\nSize and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\n\nVariant: Encumbrance\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.   If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are\nencumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.  If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead\nheavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\n\nDexterity\nDexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\n\nDexterity Checks\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\nAcrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\nSleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.\nStealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip\naway without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\nOther Dexterity Checks. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent\n•Steer a chariot around a tight turn\n•Pick a lock\n•Disable a trap\n•Securely tie up a prisoner\n•Wriggle free of bonds\n•Play a stringed instrument\n•Craft a small or detailed object\n\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\n\nArmor Class\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\n\nInitiative\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.\n\nHiding\nThe GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\nYou can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.\nAn invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a\ncreature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.\nPassive Perception.When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st--level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\nWhat Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be\nlightlyor\nheavily obscured, as explained in \"The Environment.”\n\nConstitution\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\n\nConstitution Checks\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.  The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Hold your breath\n•March or labor for hours without rest\n•Go without sleep\n•Survive without food or water\n•Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go\n\nHit Points\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.  If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\n\nIntelligence\nIntelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.\n\nIntelligence Checks\nAn Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\n\nArcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\nHistory. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\nInvestigation. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nNature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\nReligion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures\nyour ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\nOther Intelligence Checks. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Communicate with a creature without using words\n•Estimate the value of a precious item\n•Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard\n•Forge a document\n•Recall lore about a craft or trade\n•Win a game of skill\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nWizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nWisdom\nWisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.\n\nWisdom Checks\nA Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\nAnimal Handling. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\nInsight. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\nMedicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\nPerception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\nSurvival. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\nOther Wisdom Checks. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow\n•Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nClerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nCharisma\nCharisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.\n\nCharisma Checks\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\n\nDeception. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception\ncan encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\n\nIntimidation. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\n\nPerformance. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\n\nPersuasion. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include\nconvincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\nOther Charisma Checks. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors,and gossip\n•Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nSaving Throws\nA saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm. To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw. A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM. Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\n\nTime\nIn situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of\nminutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.  In a city or wilderness, a scale of\nhours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.  For long journeys, a scale of\ndays works best. Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.  In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on\nrounds, a 6-second span of time.\n\nMovement\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.  The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.”  Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.\n\nSpeed\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\nTravel Pace\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\nForced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix PH-A).\nMounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a\ncarpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n\nTravel Pace\nPace                         \nDistance Traveled per . . .  \nMinute                       Hour       Day       Effect     \nFast                         400  feet  4  miles  30  miles  − 5 penalty to passiv e Wisdom (Perception) scores  \nNormal                       300  feet  3  miles  24  miles  -                                                   \nSlow                         200  feet  2  miles  18  miles  Able to use stealth                                 \n"], "response": "**Passive Skill Checks in D&D 5e**\n\n| What you’re checking | Formula | Example |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|\n| **Passive Perception** (most common) | `10 + proficiency bonus + relevant ability modifier (+ any situational bonus)` | A level‑5 rogue (Prof +3, Dex +4) has `10 + 3 + 4 = 17`. |\n| **Any other skill** | Same as above | A bard with proficiency +2 in Persuasion and Charisma +3 has passive Persuasion `10 + 2 + 3 = 15`. |\n\n### Why 10?\nA passive check represents the *average* result of a d20 roll (10.5, rounded down to 10).

{"user_input": "How can I use the Time rules to add flvour to my campaign?", "reference_contexts": ["Passive Checks\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\nHere’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a\nscore.\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.  The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.\n\nWorking Together\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.  A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\n\nGroup Checks\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.  To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.  Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\n\nUsing Each Ability\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\n\nStrength\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\n\nStrength Checks\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\nAthletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:\n•You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff,avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.\n•You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.\n•You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\nOther Strength Checks. The GM might also call fora Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door\n•Break free of bonds\n•Push through a tunnel that is too small\n•Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it\n•Tip over a statue\n•Keep a boulder from rolling\n\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\n\nLifting and Carrying\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\n\nCarrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength\nscore multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough\nthat most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.\nPush, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\nSize and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\n\nVariant: Encumbrance\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.   If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are\nencumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.  If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead\nheavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\n\nDexterity\nDexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\n\nDexterity Checks\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\nAcrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\nSleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.\nStealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip\naway without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\nOther Dexterity Checks. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent\n•Steer a chariot around a tight turn\n•Pick a lock\n•Disable a trap\n•Securely tie up a prisoner\n•Wriggle free of bonds\n•Play a stringed instrument\n•Craft a small or detailed object\n\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\n\nArmor Class\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\n\nInitiative\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.\n\nHiding\nThe GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\nYou can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.\nAn invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a\ncreature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.\nPassive Perception.When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st--level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\nWhat Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be\nlightlyor\nheavily obscured, as explained in \"The Environment.”\n\nConstitution\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\n\nConstitution Checks\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.  The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Hold your breath\n•March or labor for hours without rest\n•Go without sleep\n•Survive without food or water\n•Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go\n\nHit Points\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.  If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\n\nIntelligence\nIntelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.\n\nIntelligence Checks\nAn Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\n\nArcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\nHistory. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\nInvestigation. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nNature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\nReligion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures\nyour ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\nOther Intelligence Checks. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Communicate with a creature without using words\n•Estimate the value of a precious item\n•Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard\n•Forge a document\n•Recall lore about a craft or trade\n•Win a game of skill\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nWizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nWisdom\nWisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.\n\nWisdom Checks\nA Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\nAnimal Handling. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\nInsight. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\nMedicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\nPerception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\nSurvival. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\nOther Wisdom Checks. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow\n•Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nClerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nCharisma\nCharisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.\n\nCharisma Checks\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\n\nDeception. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception\ncan encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\n\nIntimidation. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\n\nPerformance. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\n\nPersuasion. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include\nconvincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\nOther Charisma Checks. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n•Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors,and gossip\n•Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n\nSaving Throws\nA saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm. To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw. A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM. Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.\n\nTime\nIn situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of\nminutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.  In a city or wilderness, a scale of\nhours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.  For long journeys, a scale of\ndays works best. Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.  In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on\nrounds, a 6-second span of time.\n\nMovement\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope-all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.  The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.”  Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.\n\nSpeed\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\n\nTravel Pace\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\nForced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix PH-A).\nMounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a\ncarpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\n\nTravel Pace\nPace                         \nDistance Traveled per . . .  \nMinute                       Hour       Day       Effect     \nFast                         400  feet  4  miles  30  miles  − 5 penalty to passiv e Wisdom (Perception) scores  \nNormal                       300  feet  3  miles  24  miles  -                                                   \nSlow                         200  feet  2  miles  18  miles  Able to use stealth                                 \n"], "response": "Below is a practical “cheat‑sheet” of ways to turn the otherwise‑dry mechanics of time in D&D 5e (and a few cross‑rules from other editions) into flavorful narrative beats, world‑building tools, and plot hooks.  Pick the ones that fit your style and the tone of your game.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Use the Official Calendar & Seasons\n\n| Element | How to Use It |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Calendar (30‑day months, 12 months)** | Give NPCs a “date” for birthdays, festivals, or treaties.  A quest that must be finished by the “Festival of the Sun” feels urgent. |\n| **Seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)** | Tie climate to mechanics: heavy snow reduces movement, harvest festivals give extra XP, or the “Winter Solstice” is when a necromancer’s power peaks. |\n| **Time of Day** | Dawn/Daytime can grant advantage on stealth checks in shadows; dusk/darkness can empower certain spells (e.g., *Darkness*, *Misty Step*). |\n\n**Flavor tip:** Write a “calendar of the realm” in your campaign book, and let players consult it for planning.  A “Month of the Red Moon” could be a yearly eclipse event that powers a dragon’s lair.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Track Long‑Term Time for World‑Building\n\n| Tool | What It Adds |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Timeline of World Events** | Map out major wars, founding of nations, or the rise of a powerful mage.  Your players can reference how past heroes shaped the land. |\n| **Character Aging** | Use the DMG rule that a character ages one year per *calendar year* of in‑game time.  Aging can affect skills, physical limits, and social standing. |\n| **Long‑Resting** | DMG (p. 146) suggests a “long rest” lasts 8 hours, but you can introduce *extended rests* (weeks, months) for training, forging items, or healing.  Players can “train a month to master a new feat” at a cost. |\n| **Historical Lore** | Embed rumors that “the city was founded 500 years ago during the Great Flood.”  Players might find artifacts tied to that age. |\n\n**Flavor tip:** Let the calendar drive pacing—your campaign can have a “Three‑Year Plan” to rebuild a fallen kingdom, giving players a long‑term goal with time limits.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Time‑Based Quests & Deadlines\n\n| Scenario | Mechanics |\n|----------|-----------|\n| **Countdown to a Siege** | The town must raise a barricade in 72 hours.  Each hour of real time can be a “battle round” in the game. |\n| **Timed Races** | A dragon’s lair is only open for 24 in‑game hours after the first full moon.  Players must race against time. |\n| **Seasonal Fairs** | The “Harvest Festival” ends after a week; quests must finish before the festival begins. |\n| **Temporal Rifts** | An area of time distortion collapses after a set number of days, forcing players to escape. |\n\n**Flavor tip:** Use the *Time Stop* spell (5e p. 285) as a dramatic plot twist—players must finish a critical task before time snaps back.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Temporal Mechanics as Plot Devices\n\n| Mechanic | Plot Hook |\n|----------|-----------|\n| **Time‑Stop** | A villain stops time to trap the party in a loop; they must break the spell before the loop repeats. |\n| **Haste / Slow** | The entire city is affected by *Haste* or *Slow* for an hour, changing how NPCs behave. |\n| **Chronomancy Feats** | Characters can use the “Chronomancer” background to manipulate time in small ways (e.g., “retrace the last 10 minutes” to avoid a trap). |\n| **Time‑Travel** | Introduce optional rules from DMG or homebrew: “The Clockwork Citadel” can send a party back to the 17th‑century version of the realm. |\n\n**Flavor tip:** Frame time‑related magic as a rare, dangerous art.  Maybe the city’s guild forbids *Chronomancy* because of past catastrophes.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Time‑Based Economy & Crafting\n\n| Feature | Flavor |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Crafting Time** | Forge a sword takes 7 days.  Players may spend money to accelerate to 3 days.  Use this for “race‑to‑forge” quests. |\n| **Market Prices** | Prices rise or fall based on seasonal demand—grain is cheaper in spring, luxury items expensive in winter. |\n| **Restorative Effects** | A *Potion of Long Rest* can simulate a 30‑day healing period for a sick NPC, giving a sense of genuine recuperation. |\n\n**Flavor tip:** Let the economics of time affect your campaign’s politics—knights may be paid in “future gold” to pay for a war’s toll.\n\n---\n\n## 6. World Events that Depend on Time\n\n| Event | How to Tie It to Time |\n|-------|-----------------------|\n| **The Eclipse of Ythril** | Occurs every 10 years; during the eclipse, a dormant portal opens. |\n| **The Rotting Season** | A disease spreads for exactly 42 days, after which it ends. |\n| **The Annual Dragon Hunt** | A dragon’s lair is only accessible on the 13th of the 7th month. |\n\n**Flavor tip:** Schedule your campaign’s climax around a rare celestial event to create a sense of destiny and inevitability.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Quick Reference Cheat‑Sheet\n\n| Rule | DMG/PHB Source | Quick Hook |\n|------|----------------|------------|\n| Calendar (30‑day months) | DMG p. 111 | \"The Harvest Festival is in 3 days!\" |\n| Long Rest = 8 hours | PHB p. 247 | “You have 8 hours before the tide turns.” |\n| Aging (1 year per calendar year) | DMG p. 110 | “Your old mentor will be in his 80s soon.” |\n| *Time Stop* | PHB p. 285 | “A mage stops time to trap you.” |\n| *Haste* | PHB p. 282 | “The battlefield moves twice as fast.” |\n\n---\n\n### How to Pick the Right Tools\n\n1. **Campaign Length** – For short one‑off adventures, focus on *short‑term* time (hours/days).  For epic sagas, bring in *long‑term* calendar events and aging.\n2. **Tone** – A high‑fantasy epic uses grand celestial events; a gritty noir may emphasize city‑wide deadlines and ticking clocks.\n3. **Player Interest** – If your group loves lore, give them a timeline of the realm’s history.  If they enjoy puzzles, time‑stop loops or timed riddles can be great.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thought\n\nTime in D&D is more than a mechanic; it’s a narrative device that can:\n\n- **Add urgency** (deadlines, countdowns).  \n- **Drive character growth** (aging, long‑term training).  \n- **Enrich the world** (seasonal festivals, world events).  \n- **Power magic** (chronomancy, temporal effects).\n\nUse the official rules as scaffolding, then sprinkle your own world‑building flourishes on top.  The result is a campaign that feels alive, dynamic, and bound by a believable, ever‑moving clock.", "reference": "In the rules, the GM decides the time a task requires.

In a city or wilderness setting, a scale of hours is more appropriate; for example, adventurers can cover fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.

{"user_input": "what is passive checks and how calculate score no roll?", "reference_contexts": ["Passive Checks A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster. Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check: 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score. For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14. The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules. Working Together Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort-or the one with the highest ability modifier-can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action. A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help. Group Checks When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t. To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards."], "response": "**Passive checks** are a way to determine whether a character notices or notices something without actually rolling a d20.  \nIn 5th‑edition D&D they are most commonly used for Perception and Investigation, but the same idea applies to any skill.\n\n### How to calculate a passive score\n\n1. **Take the skill’s modifier**  \n   * Ability modifier (e.g., +2 from a 14 Intelligence)  \n   * Add the proficiency bonus if the character is proficient in that skill (e.g., +3).\n\n2. **Add 10**  \n   `Passive score = 10 + (ability mod + proficiency bonus, if any)`\n\n> **Example** – A rogue with Intelligence 14 (+2) and Investigation proficiency (+3):  \n> Passive Investigation = 10 + 2 + 3 = **15**.\n\n### When passive checks are used\n\n- **Detecting hidden creatures or objects** – The DM rolls a *passive Perception* for the target.

Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. Divine Domain Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. Domain Spells Each domain has a list of spells-its domain spells-that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. Channel Divinity At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

A high‑Con cleric can stay in the thick of a melee, shrugging blows while still chanting a healing spell. A low‑Con cleric is the “fragile” support that must retreat or be shielded. |\n| **Concentration & Con saves** | A spell’s concentration check is made against a DC 10 or the attacker’s attack roll (whichever is higher). Constitution saves are made for effects that require them (e.g., poison, disease). | A high Con mod means fewer concentration checks fail and a higher chance to keep a buff like *Bless* or *Aid* active. Narratively, the cleric can “keep a steady hand” even as the battlefield rages. A low mod can make the cleric’s protective auras feel fragile, with a palpable risk of losing them mid‑battle. |\n\n---\n\n### 1.  **Resilience in combat**\n\n* **Higher HP → Front‑line presence**  \n  A cleric with a +4 Con mod gets +4 HP per level. In a 5‑elevator campaign where a party might exchange 15–20 hp per round, that extra pool lets the cleric absorb a few more hits before needing to retreat. Role‑play‑wise, the DM might describe the cleric shrugging off a *Fireball* splash or standing firm while the party takes a rout.\n\n* **Concentration stability**  \n  Many cleric spells—*Bless*, *Shield of Faith*, *Aid*, *Spirit Guardians*—require concentration. The chance to keep them up is tied to the DC you face and your Con mod. A +3 mod means the cleric’s concentration saves are +3 harder to fail. In narrative terms, the cleric can “maintain his focus” even when an enemy swings a greatsword at him, keeping allies protected.\n\n* **Con saves for poison, disease, etc.**  \n  Domains that deal with plague or necromancy (e.g., *Plague* or *Necromancy* from a Homebrew) often call for Con saves. A higher mod makes the cleric more resilient to these effects, allowing the character to stay in play while resisting environmental hazards.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  **Narrative presence**\n\n| Narrative angle | How Con mod shapes it |\n|-----------------|----------------------|\n| **Stoic anchor** | A cleric with a high Con mod is described as “enduring” or “steadfast.” The DM may write, *“Despite the thunderous crash, the cleric’s shield remains unshaken.”* |\n| **Vulnerable healer** | A low Con mod can be a narrative hook: *“She’s taking a blow, the spell fizzles as she gasps for breath.”* It forces the party to protect her, creating tension. |\n| **Role‑playing choices** | A high‑Con cleric might willingly “charge forward” with a *Shield of Faith*, whereas a low‑Con one might opt for *Dispel Magic* from a distance. |\n| **Alignment with domain** | War domain clerics benefit from high Con to keep fighting; Life domain clerics rely on HP to heal. A low Con can make a Life domain feel less heroic, pushing the character to adopt a “protective” rather than “tactical” posture. |\n\n---\n\n### 3.  **Practical tips for players**\n\n1. **Track Con mod as a “resilience marker.”**  \n   When the DM narrates a hit, they can reference the cleric’s Con mod to decide if the character “holds steady” or “drops the spell.”\n\n2. **Use Con to justify tactics.**  \n   If your cleric has a +2 Con, you might say, *“I keep my concentration on *Aid* while letting the enemy hit me.”* The DM can grant a 1‑round bonus to the concentration check because of the “steady hand.”\n\n3. **Plan for low‑Con characters.**  \n   A low Con mod should prompt you to position the cleric on the back line, use *Shield of Faith*, or cast *Sanctuary* to reduce the likelihood of a concentration break.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA cleric’s Constitution modifier is the single most important factor that determines how “tough” the character feels in combat and how reliably they can keep their protective spells active.

Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a holy symbol (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. Divine Domain Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. Domain Spells Each domain has a list of spells-its domain spells-that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. Channel Divinity At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between", "<2-hop>\n\nCleric Class Features As a cleric, you gain the following class features.

Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Destroy Undead Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table. Destroy Undead Cleric Level Destroys Undead of CR . . . 5th 1/2 or lower 8th 1 or lower 11th 2 or lower 14th 3 or lower 17th 4 or lower Divine Intervention Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required."], "response": "**How Wisdom Shapes a Cleric’s Spellcasting**\n\n| Aspect | Formula / Rule | What Wisdom Does |\n|--------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Spells Prepared** | *Cleric Level + Wisdom modifier* (minimum 0) | Each level you can add **+1** spell to your daily list for every point of Wisdom you have. A higher Wisdom gives you a bigger pool of options, letting you tailor your spell‑selection more flexibly to the situation. |\n| **Spell Save DC** | 8 + Proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier | The DC that a creature must beat to resist your spells (e.g., *bless*, *hold person*, *spiritual weapon*) is directly tied to Wisdom. Every point of Wisdom increases the DC by **+1**, making your spells harder to resist. |\n| **Turn Undead DC** | 5 + Wisdom modifier | When you use Channel Divinity to “Turn Undead,” the creatures that can resist must make a Wisdom‑based check. Each point of Wisdom raises the threshold by **+1**, improving your chance to turn or frighten the undead. |\n\n---\n\n### Interrelationships\n\n1. **More Prepared Spells → More Opportunities to Support Turn Undead**  \n   - A larger spell pool lets you choose spells that amplify your Turn Undead (e.g., *hold person* to restrict undead, *spiritual weapon* to create extra damage, *cure wounds* to keep allies healthy).  \n   - While the Turn Undead DC itself isn’t affected by how many spells you have prepared, the overall combat effectiveness of the cleric’s “support” increases because you can choose the right spells on a given day.\n\n2. **Wisdom Drives All DCs**  \n   - Since Wisdom feeds **both** the spellcasting DC and the Turn Undead DC, a single stat governs the difficulty your enemies face from any cleric action.  \n   - This unified scaling means you can plan character builds around maximizing Wisdom to raise all your spell‑based defenses and offensive checks.\n\n3. **Channel Divinity Uses a Separate Resource**  \n   - Channel Divinity can be used once per short rest (or twice per long rest at higher levels).  \n   - It isn’t limited by Wisdom directly, but the DC you set (5 + Wisdom) is what determines whether undead flee or become frightened.  \n   - Thus, a higher Wisdom not only increases the raw DC but also lets you consistently “turn” more of the undead you encounter.\n\n4. **Proficiency Bonus Adds Consistency**  \n   - Your proficiency bonus, added to all spell DCs, grows with level. Wisdom merely adds a flat **+1** per modifier point, so the relative impact of Wisdom diminishes slightly at very high levels, but the absolute advantage remains.  \n   - Example (10th‑level cleric, Wis 18 → +4 mod):  \n     - Spell DC = 8 + +4 (prof) + +4 (Wis) = **16**.  \n     - Turn Undead DC = 5 + +4 = **9**.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **Wisdom is the cleric’s “meta‑stat.”** It tells you how many spells you can prepare, how hard those spells are to resist, and how powerful your Turn Undead checks are.  \n- A higher Wisdom **directly expands** both your tactical options (more spells) and your raw power (higher DCs).  \n- Channel Divinity’s Turn Undead feature is a separate action that still depends on Wisdom for its DC, so a good Wisdom score ensures that whenever you decide to turn the undead, you’re doing so with the best possible odds.  \n\nIn short, a cleric’s effectiveness is strongly tied to Wisdom—maximizing that stat unlocks a larger spell repertoire, higher resistance‑break DCs, and more reliable undead control.", "reference": "The Wisdom stat is the cleric’s spellcasting ability. It determines the number of spells a cleric can prepare each day: you choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier plus your cleric level (minimum one).

In addition, the Turn Undead feature requires a Wisdom saving throw from each undead that can see or hear the cleric; if the creature fails, it is turned. Thus, a higher Wisdom not only expands the cleric’s prepared spell list and raises the difficulty of saving throws against their spells, but also makes the Turn Undead effect more potent by increasing the DC of the saving throw the undead must make.", "answer_relevancy": 0.6945966417880457, "semantic_similarity": 0.5494418352947635, "bleu_score": 0.034748905597584166, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.16867469879518074, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.1050656660412758, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.42748091603053434}
{"user_input": "how many spell slots a wizard can use before rest and how do they get them back?", "reference_contexts": ["Damage Types\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.  The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\nAcid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage.\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.\nFire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\n\nDamage Resistance and\n\nVulnerability\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\nIf a creature or an object has\nresistanceto a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has\nvulnerabilityto a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers\nto damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved,\nso the creature takes 10 damage.\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\n\nHealing\nUnless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a\ncure woundsspell or a potion of healing\ncan remove damage in an instant.\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\nA creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the\nrevivifyspell has restored it to life.\n\nDropping to 0 Hit Points\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\n\nInstant Death\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.  For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\n\nFalling Unconscious\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix PH-A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\n\nDeath Saving Throws\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.  Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\n\nStabilizing a Creature\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.  You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nA\nstablecreature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\n\nMonsters and Death\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\n\nKnocking a Creature Out\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\n\nTemporary Hit Points\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\nHealing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed\nat you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.  Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.\n\nMounted Combat\nA knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.   A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.\n\nMounting and Di smounting\nOnce during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.  If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.  If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.\n\nControlling a Mount\nWhile you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently. You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\nIn either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the\nmount.\n\nUnderwater Combat\nWhen adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.\nWhen making a\nmelee weapon attack, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.\nA\nranged weapon attackautomatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).\nCreatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.\n\n\nSpellcasting\nMagic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.  This section provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.\n\nWhat Is a Spell?\nA spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in most cases, all in the span of seconds.  Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix PH-A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.  Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.\n\nSpell Level\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.  Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\n\nKnown and Prepared Spells\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\nIn every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.\n\nSpell Slots\nRegardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\nWhen a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level\nslot. So when Umara casts magic missile,a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.\nSome characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\n\nCasting a Spell at a Higher Level\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts\nmagic missileusing one of her 2nd-level slots, that\nmagic missileis 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\nSome spells, such as magic missileand cure wounds\n, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.\n\nCasting in Armor\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n\nCantrips\nA cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.\n\nRituals\nCertain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.  To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.\n\nCasting a Spell\nWhen a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.  Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.\n\nCasting T ime\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\n\nBonus Action\nA spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\n\nReactions\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\n\nLonger Casting Times\nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\n\nRange\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like\nmagic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like\nfireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the\nshieldspell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.\nSpells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect”).\nOnce a spell is cast,its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.\n\nComponents\nA spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.\n\nVerbal (V)\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the\nsilencespell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.\n\nSomatic (S)\nSpellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell\nrequires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\n\nMaterial (M)\nCasting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a\ncomponent pouch or a\nspellcasting focus (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.  If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.  A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\n\nDuration\nA spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\n\nInstantaneous\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n\nConcentration\nSome spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.  If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).  Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n•\nCasting another spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.\n•\nTaking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\n•\nBeing incapacitated or killed.You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\n"], "response": "**Spell slots per day**\n\nA wizard’s spell‑slot capacity is set by the *Spellcasting* table in the Player’s Handbook.  \nBelow is the table that shows the slots a wizard has at each level:\n\n| Wizard level | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th |\n|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 1 | 2 | – | – | – | – | – | – | – | – |\n| 2 | 3 | – | – | – | – | – | – | – | – |\n| 3 | 4 | 2 | – | – | – | – | – | – | – |\n| 4 | 4 | 3 | – | – | – | – | – | – | – |\n| 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | – | – | – | – | – | – |\n| 6 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | – | – | – | – | – |\n| 7 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | – | – | – | – |\n| 8 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | – | – | – |\n| 9 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | – | – |\n|10|4|3|3|2|2|2|2|1|–|\n|11|4|3|3|2|2|2|2|2|1|\n|12|4|3|3|2|2|2|2|2|2|\n|13|4|3|3|2|2|2|2|2|3|\n|14|4|3|3|2|2|2|2|3|3|\n|15|4|3|3|2|2|2|3|3|3|\n|16|4|3|3|2|2|3|3|3|3|\n|17|4|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|3|\n|18|4|3|4|3|3|3|3|3|3|\n|19|4|4|4|3|3|3|3|3|3|\n|20|4|4|4|4|3|3|3|3|3|\n\n*You can cast spells only at levels for which you have slots; you can’t “over‑level” a spell to a higher level and still use a lower‑level slot.*\n\n**How spell slots are restored**\n\n| Rest type | Spell slots restored |\n|-----------|----------------------|\n| **Short rest** | *No* spell slots are recovered.

{"user_input": "What movement cost and risks are involved when a character mounts or dismounts a creature during combat?", "reference_contexts": ["Damage Types\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.  The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\nAcid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage.\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.\nFire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\n\nDamage Resistance and\n\nVulnerability\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\nIf a creature or an object has\nresistanceto a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has\nvulnerabilityto a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers\nto damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved,\nso the creature takes 10 damage.\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\n\nHealing\nUnless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a\ncure woundsspell or a potion of healing\ncan remove damage in an instant.\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\nA creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the\nrevivifyspell has restored it to life.\n\nDropping to 0 Hit Points\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\n\nInstant Death\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.  For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\n\nFalling Unconscious\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix PH-A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\n\nDeath Saving Throws\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.  Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\n\nStabilizing a Creature\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.  You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nA\nstablecreature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\n\nMonsters and Death\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\n\nKnocking a Creature Out\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\n\nTemporary Hit Points\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\nHealing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed\nat you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.  Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.\n\nMounted Combat\nA knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.   A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.\n\nMounting and Di smounting\nOnce during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.  If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.  If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.\n\nControlling a Mount\nWhile you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently. You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\nIn either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the\nmount.\n\nUnderwater Combat\nWhen adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.\nWhen making a\nmelee weapon attack, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.\nA\nranged weapon attackautomatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).\nCreatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.\n\n\nSpellcasting\nMagic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.  This section provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.\n\nWhat Is a Spell?\nA spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in most cases, all in the span of seconds.  Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix PH-A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.  Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.\n\nSpell Level\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.  Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\n\nKnown and Prepared Spells\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\nIn every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.\n\nSpell Slots\nRegardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\nWhen a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level\nslot. So when Umara casts magic missile,a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.\nSome characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\n\nCasting a Spell at a Higher Level\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts\nmagic missileusing one of her 2nd-level slots, that\nmagic missileis 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\nSome spells, such as magic missileand cure wounds\n, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.\n\nCasting in Armor\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n\nCantrips\nA cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.\n\nRituals\nCertain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.  To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.\n\nCasting a Spell\nWhen a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.  Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.\n\nCasting T ime\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\n\nBonus Action\nA spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\n\nReactions\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\n\nLonger Casting Times\nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\n\nRange\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like\nmagic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like\nfireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the\nshieldspell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.\nSpells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect”).\nOnce a spell is cast,its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.\n\nComponents\nA spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.\n\nVerbal (V)\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the\nsilencespell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.\n\nSomatic (S)\nSpellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell\nrequires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\n\nMaterial (M)\nCasting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a\ncomponent pouch or a\nspellcasting focus (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.  If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.  A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\n\nDuration\nA spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\n\nInstantaneous\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n\nConcentration\nSome spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.  If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).  Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n•\nCasting another spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.\n•\nTaking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\n•\nBeing incapacitated or killed.You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\n"], "response": "**5e rules for mounting & dismounting in combat**\n\n| Action | Movement cost | How you do it | What you can’t do | Risks / checks |\n|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Mount a willing creature** | *No extra cost.* You can mount as part of your **move** (no action). | Move onto the creature’s back or within 5 ft of it, then climb up. | You can’t exceed the mount’s speed.

Could you provide a comprehensive overview that covers both mechanical and narrative aspects?", "reference_contexts": ["Damage Types Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types. The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect. Acid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage. Bludgeoning. Blunt force attacks-hammers, falling, constriction, and the like-deal bludgeoning damage. Cold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage. Fire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage. Force. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon. Lightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage. Necrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul. Piercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage. Poison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage. Psychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage. Radiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power. Slashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage. Thunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage. Damage Resistance and Vulnerability Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. If a creature or an object has resistanceto a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerabilityto a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it. Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage. Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters."], "response": "## Acid Damage in 5E – A Complete Overview\n\n| Section | What it covers |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **Mechanical core** | Damage type, how it’s applied, interaction with resistance/vulnerability, special rules from DMG. |\n| **Common sources** | Monster attacks, spells, and environmental hazards. |\n| **Narrative flavor** | How acid feels, smells, and looks; visual and sensory cues. |\n| **GM‑tips** | Creative ways to weave acid into your world, storytelling hooks, and balance tricks. |\n\n---\n\n### 1. Mechanical Core\n\n| Rule | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Damage type** | Acid is one of the seven “elemental” damage types (alongside bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, fire, cold, lightning, and thunder). It is treated like any other damage type when applying resistances, vulnerabilities, and damage immunities. |\n| **Resistance** | If a creature has resistance to acid (half damage), the damage is halved. |\n| **Vulnerability** | If a creature has vulnerability to acid (double damage), the damage is doubled. |\n| **Immunity** | Certain creatures (e.g., lizardfolk, many oozes, some dragons) are immune; they take no acid damage. |\n| **DMG: Corrosion** | **DMG p. 245**: “If a creature wearing metal armor takes acid damage, the armor’s AC bonus is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) until it is repaired.” The same rule applies to metal shields. (You can apply it to other metal items if you want.) |\n| **Acid and objects** | Objects that take acid damage take it normally. If they have hit points (e.g., a wooden door or a metal chest), the damage is subtracted from those hit points. The DM may decide that a metal object is *corroded* and its AC or durability is lowered (house‑rule). |\n| **Ongoing damage** | The rules don’t grant acid a “leaching” or “burn‑on‑hit” effect. If you want ongoing damage (e.g., a puddle of acid), you must state it or roll per round. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Common Sources of Acid Damage\n\n| Source | Typical Damage | Notes |\n|--------|----------------|-------|\n| **Black Dragon Breath** | 6d6 acid (Young), 10d6 (Adult), 12d6 (Ancient) | Classic Lair hazard; area of effect is a 60‑ft cone. |\n| **Black Pudding** | 4d6 acid (normal attack) + 1d6 acid on a successful save (acid splatter) | Oozes and puddings use the “acid” damage for their attacks. |\n| **Acid Splash** (cantrip) | 1d6 acid, +1d6 if you hit | Easy to use; can be thrown or used as a touch. |\n| **Acid Arrow** | 3d6 acid + 1d6 extra if you hit | Ranged spell; deals extra acid to a single target. |\n| **Wall of Acid** | 5d8 acid (area damage) | A 20‑ft wall of acid that deals damage to anyone in or through it. |\n| **Acidic Mist** | 3d6 acid per round, 2 rounds (wizard’s 3rd‑level spell) | Creates a zone of acid that causes damage each turn. |\n| **Environmental Hazards** | Acid pools, acid rain, acid springs, acid‑coated surfaces | Can be found in swamps, volcanoes, or ruined labs. |\n| **Alchemical Items** | Acid flasks (2d4 acid), acid bombs, corrosive liquids | Often used by alchemists, smugglers, or villainous factions. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Narrative Flavor\n\n- **Visual**: Acid burns with a bright, almost *greenish‑yellow* glow and fizzles on contact. When it hits metal, it “drips” like hot syrup, leaving a slick of corrosive sheen.\n- **Smell**: A sharp, sulfurous stench reminiscent of a ruined factory or a freshly opened can of *sulfuric acid*. The smell lingers in the air, warning of lingering danger.\n- **Physical sensation**: A sting that *seems to burn deeper the longer it stays in contact*. If you’re wearing metal, you might feel a *cold, numbing pressure* as the metal “melts” away. For a creature, the damage is a searing burn that can cause the skin to *char and blister*, leaving a white, peeling scar.\n- **Acid’s effect on equipment**: Metal items may *sizzle* and *clang* as they’re slowly “melted” away, and even a single blow can render a sword useless after a few rounds in a corrosive pool.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Creative Ways for GMs to Use Acid\n\n| Idea | How It Enhances Storytelling | Suggested Mechanics |\n|------|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Acid Pools as a Hazard** | Forces players to plan for traversal or avoid the floor. An acid pit can be a death trap or a puzzle. | DM can require a Dexterity check to avoid falling, then impose 2d6 acid damage on a failed save. |\n| **Corroded Armor** | A black‑drake lair can literally “strip” the heroes’ armor. It’s a tangible, irreversible penalty that heightens the stakes. | Each round the party is in the lair, metal armor AC bonus is reduced by 1 (use DMG rule). |\n| **Acid‑Laced Traps** | Pressure plates trigger a burst of acid or a spray from a concealed wall. Adds danger to exploration. | 2d6 acid damage to any creature on the trigger, and an area effect of 10‑ft radius. |\n| **Acid‑Scented Clues** | A villain left a trail of acid that smells different; players can follow it. | Use a Perception or Investigation check to detect the scent and follow. |\n| **Acid‑Ruin** | An ancient city’s metal fortifications crumble in a storm of acid rain. The players must find a way to shield themselves. | AC reduction of metal items, extra damage for those without protective gear. |\n| **Acid as a Puzzle Element** | A door locked with a metal padlock that dissolves in acid. The players must find an acid source or a way to heat the lock. | Requires the use of an acid flask (2d4 damage to the lock, must be successful on a DC 15 Thieves’ Tools check). |\n| **Acid‑Coated Weapons** | A black‑pudding’s splash damage can permanently degrade a sword, forcing the party to find a replacement. | When a sword takes 5 acid damage, it “rusts” and loses a +1 bonus until repaired. |\n| **Acidic Fog** | An area of lingering acid mist that requires a DC 12 Constitution saving throw each round to avoid 1d6 acid damage. | Adds a persistent danger that forces players to keep moving. |\n| **Acidic Creatures as Allies/Enemies** | A sentient ooze that can “speak” through acid and offers knowledge in exchange for help. | Gives a role‑playing hook and a potential ally or foe. |\n| **Acidic Spores** | A fungus that releases a cloud of acid spores when disturbed. Useful for ambushes. | 2d6 acid damage to anyone in the cloud; DC 13 Constitution save. |\n| **Acid‑Powered Items** | Give a weapon that deals extra acid damage or an alchemist’s flask that “glows” when heated. | Add flavor items that can be crafted or found. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Balancing Tips\n\n1. **Don’t overuse acid for mundane fights** – it’s a powerful type that can damage armor, making battles feel unfair if applied indiscriminately.\n2. **Use acid to punish over‑reliance on metal gear** – good for a setting where magical protection is scarce, but be careful not to make armor unusable too quickly.\n3. **Combine acid with other damage types** – many enemies (e.g., dragons) deal *acid + fire*, making them a challenge for armor‑heavy parties.\n4. **Give players tools to mitigate** – acid‑proof gloves, special shields, or spells like *Protection from Acid* can give them agency.\n5. **House‑rule progressive AC damage** – If you want a more visceral feel, lower the AC bonus of metal items by 1 for every 10 acid damage they take.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Quick Reference Table\n\n| Damage Source | Typical Damage | Notable Features |\n|---------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Black Dragon Breath | 6d6/10d6/12d6 acid | 60‑ft cone, permanent Lair Hazard |\n| Black Pudding | 4d6 acid (normal) + 1d6 acid (splat) | Oozes, constant acid splatter |\n| Acid Splash (cantrip) | 1d6 acid (+1d6) | Easy, ranged, touch |\n| Acid Arrow | 3d6 acid (+1d6) | Ranged, single target |\n| Wall of Acid | 5d8 acid | 20‑ft wall, area |\n| Acidic Mist | 3d6 acid per round | 2 rounds, zone |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Final Takeaway\n\nAcid damage is a versatile tool in 5E: it gives you a damage type that can erode armor, degrade gear, and add a distinct sensory flavor to combat and exploration. Use it sparingly to keep the stakes high, pair it with environmental hazards for cinematic moments, and let it become a narrative device that reflects the world’s chemistry and danger. By weaving acid into your setting—whether through dragon lairs, oozes, alchemical traps, or polluted swamps—you can create memorable, dynamic encounters that keep players on their toes and tell a story of corrosion, resilience, and adaptation.", "reference": "Acid damage is one of the many damage types in D&D 5e.

{"user_input": "What is a death saving throw?", "reference_contexts": ["Healing Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a cure woundsspell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant. When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8. A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the revivifyspell has restored it to life. Dropping to 0 Hit Points When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections. Instant Death Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies. Falling Unconscious If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix PH-A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points. Death Saving Throws Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw. Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable. Rolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point. Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death."], "response": "**Death Saving Throw (D&D 5th Edition)**  \nA death saving throw is the mechanism the game uses to determine whether a character who has fallen to 0 hit points (and is not already stabilized or dead) can recover or will die.\n\n| What happens | What you roll | Result |\n|--------------|---------------|--------|\n| **Success** | d20 ≥ 10 | +1 success |\n| **Failure** | d20 ≤ 9 | +1 failure |\n| **Critical Success** | d20 = 20 | Immediate 1 HP (counts as a success) |\n| **Critical Failure** | d20 = 1 | Counts as two failures |\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **When it’s made**  \n   - A dying character must roll a death saving throw at the **start of each of their turns** until they either stabilize, die, or regain hit points.\n\n2. **Successes**  \n   - Three successes (not necessarily consecutive) mean the character **stabilizes**.  \n   - While stabilized, they are unconscious but no longer make death saving throws and do not die, though they still cannot take actions.\n\n3. **Failures**  \n   - Three failures mean the character **dies**.  \n   - If the character receives a *critical failure* (rolling a 1), two failures are added at once.\n\n4. **Special outcomes**  \n   - Rolling a 20 instantly restores 1 HP, ending the dying process.  \n   - A death saving throw that results in a success but the character takes damage (even 0 damage) on the next turn counts as an automatic failure.\n\n5. **Other influences**  \n   - Healing (or certain spells like *Lesser Restoration*) can end the dying state.  \n   - The *Stabilize* action (or a *Healing Word* with 1 HP) can also stop death saving throws without a roll.\n\n### Where it’s found\n- Player’s Handbook, **p. 197–198** (Death Saving Throws)\n- DMG optional rules discuss stabilizing and critical failures.\n\nIn short: **A death saving throw is a d20 roll at the start of a dying character’s turn to decide whether they gain a success, fail, or die.

{"user_input": "What does a Bard give you when you multiclass?", "reference_contexts": ["Multiclassing Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character. As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility. Prerequisites To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores. Multiclassing Prerequisites Class Ability Score Minimum Barbarian Strength 13 Bard Charisma 13 Cleric Wisdom 13 Druid Wisdom 13 Fighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 Monk Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Paladin Strength 13 and Charisma 13 Ranger Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Rogue Dexterity 13 Sorcerer Charisma 13 Warlock Charisma 13 Wizard Intelligence 13 Experience Points The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric. Hit Points and Hit Dice You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice. Proficiency Bonus Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3. Proficiencies When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table. Multiclassing Proficiencies Class Proficiencies Gained Barbarian Shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Bard Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice Cleric Light armor, medium armor, shields Druid Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal) Fighter Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Monk Sim ple weapons, shortswords Paladin Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Ranger Light armor, medium armor, shields, s im ple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list Rogue Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’ tools Sorcerer - Warlock Light armor, sim ple weapons Wizard - Class Features When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting. Channel Divinity If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes. Extra Attack If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack. Unarmored Defense If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class. Spellcasting Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below.

A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level. When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels. Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up). When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.

{"user_input": "how many spell slots paladin get if multiclass with ranger?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\nAlignment A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations. These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment. Lawful good(LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good. Neutral good(NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good. Chaotic good(CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good. Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral. Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral. Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral. Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil. Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil. Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil. Alignment in the Multiverse For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery. The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.) Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil. Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments-they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.", "<2-hop>\n\ncan prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class.

Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character. As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility. Prerequisites To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores. Multiclassing Prerequisites Class Ability Score Minimum Barbarian Strength 13 Bard Charisma 13 Cleric Wisdom 13 Druid Wisdom 13 Fighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 Monk Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Paladin Strength 13 and Charisma 13 Ranger Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Rogue Dexterity 13 Sorcerer Charisma 13 Warlock Charisma 13 Wizard Intelligence 13 Experience Points The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric. Hit Points and Hit Dice You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice. Proficiency Bonus Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3. Proficiencies When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table. Multiclassing Proficiencies Class Proficiencies Gained Barbarian Shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Bard Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice Cleric Light armor, medium armor, shields Druid Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal) Fighter Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Monk Sim ple weapons, shortswords Paladin Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Ranger Light armor, medium armor, shields, s im ple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list Rogue Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’ tools Sorcerer - Warlock Light armor, sim ple weapons Wizard - Class Features When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting. Channel Divinity If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes. Extra Attack If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack. Unarmored Defense If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class. Spellcasting Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class. Spells Known and Prepared.

If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook. Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus. Spell Slots. You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table. If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher level. For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects. Pact Magic. If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations. These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment. Lawful good(LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good. Neutral good(NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good. Chaotic good(CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good. Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral. Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral. Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral. Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil. Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil. Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil. Alignment in the Multiverse For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery. The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.) Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil. Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments-they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.", "<2-hop>\n\nMulticlassing Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character. As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility. Prerequisites To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores. Multiclassing Prerequisites Class Ability Score Minimum Barbarian Strength 13 Bard Charisma 13 Cleric Wisdom 13 Druid Wisdom 13 Fighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 Monk Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Paladin Strength 13 and Charisma 13 Ranger Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Rogue Dexterity 13 Sorcerer Charisma 13 Warlock Charisma 13 Wizard Intelligence 13 Experience Points The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric. Hit Points and Hit Dice You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice. Proficiency Bonus Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3. Proficiencies When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table. Multiclassing Proficiencies Class Proficiencies Gained Barbarian Shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Bard Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice Cleric Light armor, medium armor, shields Druid Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal) Fighter Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Monk Sim ple weapons, shortswords Paladin Light armor, medium armor, shields, sim ple weapons, martial weapons Ranger Light armor, medium armor, shields, s im ple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list Rogue Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’ tools Sorcerer - Warlock Light armor, sim ple weapons Wizard - Class Features When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting. Channel Divinity If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes. Extra Attack If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack. Unarmored Defense If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class. Spellcasting Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class. Spells Known and Prepared. You determine what spells you know and"], "response": "**1. Monks in the Alignment System (as described in the first context segment)**  \nWhile the specific wording of the alignment system in your source isn’t visible here, the general rule for the monk class in most editions of D&D is that monks are **neutral‑oriented**.  \n- **Core alignment:** Monks are usually listed as **Neutral** (sometimes “Neutral Good” in 5 e if the PHB’s flavor text is followed).  \n- **Reason:** The monk’s ethos is one of self‑discipline, balance, and the pursuit of mastery rather than a strict moral code. They typically do not favor law or chaos, nor do they gravitate strongly toward good or evil.  \n- **Effect on play‑style:** Because of this neutrality, a monk can be any alignment; the alignment table in the first context would mark “Monk – Neutral” (or “Neutral Good” for 5 e flavor). This allows players to choose a wide range of personality options without any alignment restrictions.\n\n---\n\n**2. Ability‑Score Prerequisites for Multiclassing (as described in the second context segment)**  \n\n| Edition | Class | Minimum Dexterity | Minimum Wisdom | Notes |\n|---------|-------|-------------------|----------------|-------|\n| 5 e | Monk | 13 | 13 | Required for *any* monk level, whether you start as a monk or multiclass later. |\n| 4 e | Monk | 13 | 13 | Same requirement; you must meet it to gain monk levels. |\n| 3.5 | Monk | 13 | 13 | Required to take monk levels; the prerequisite remains even if you later leave the class. |\n\n**Multiclassing into a monk**  \n- You must have **Dex ≥ 13** and **Wis ≥ 13** before you can take your first monk level.  \n- If you’re a character who started in another class, you’ll need to plan your ability‑score increases (ASI, racial bonuses, feats, etc.) to meet these thresholds **before** you take the monk class.  \n- Once you meet the prerequisites, the monk’s features (Ki, Flurry of Blows, Unarmored Defense, etc.) become available, and you can continue to level in monk as long as you want.\n\n**Multiclassing *out of* monk**  \n- There is **no special “out of monk” requirement**. You can simply take levels in another class.  \n- However, the new class will have its own prerequisites (e.g., **Strength ≥ 13** for Fighter, **Charisma ≥ 13** for Bard, etc.).  \n- Because monks rely on high Dexterity and Wisdom, you’ll often want to keep those scores at or above the thresholds to maintain balance in future monk levels should you decide to return or keep the monk features.\n\n---\n\n**3. How These Prerequisites Influence Progression and Level Advancement**\n\n| Aspect | Influence | Practical Tips |\n|--------|-----------|----------------|\n| **Early Character Design** | You need to decide whether you want monk levels early (so you must hit 13 Dex/Wis before level 1) or later. | Choose a race or background that boosts Dex/Wis (e.g., Wood Elf for Dex, Gnome for Wis) or plan early ASIs to hit the thresholds. |\n| **Ability Score Growth** | Because the prerequisites are fixed, you may need to allocate a few extra ability points toward Dex/Wis to satisfy them. | Use the “Ability Score Increases” at 4th, 8th, 12th, etc., or select feats that raise those scores. |\n| **Multiclass Balance** | If you plan to mix monk with a class that prefers other stats (e.g., Fighter needs Strength), you’ll need to juggle your score increases. | Consider a “balanced” build that keeps all key scores above the required minimums. |\n| **Level‑Progression Trade‑offs** | Taking a monk level early gives you immediate Ki and mobility; delaying it keeps your character’s earlier levels in the base class. | Some players prefer to “finish” a primary class first (e.g., Fighter 4 / Monk 1) then switch, while others start monk from level 1 for full access to Ki early. |\n| **Retention of Features** | Once you’ve reached a monk level, you keep that feature regardless of later ability score changes. | Even if your Dex or Wis dips below 13 later (rare in standard play), you still keep the monk levels you earned. |\n\nIn short, the **13 Dex / 13 Wis** prerequisite is the gatekeeper for entering the monk class. It shapes early character planning and influences how you can blend monk abilities with other classes. Because monks do not require any particular alignment, your narrative choices remain flexible, letting you choose any alignment that fits your story while still meeting the numeric thresholds.", "reference": "In the alignment description, monks are listed among the lawful neutral creatures, meaning they act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. When a character wants to multiclass into the monk class, the prerequisites table in the multiclassing section states that the character must have a Dexterity score of at least 13 and a Wisdom score of at least 13. These scores must be met in addition to any ability score prerequisites of the character’s current class. Because multiclassing levels are added together to determine overall character level, a monk who gains levels in another class will still be considered a monk for alignment purposes, but the character’s total level will increase, affecting experience point requirements, hit dice, proficiency bonus, and other class features. Thus, the alignment classification remains lawful neutral, while the ability score prerequisites ensure that the character has the necessary Dexterity and Wisdom to benefit from the monk’s unarmored defense and other monk features, influencing how the character progresses across multiple classes.", "answer_relevancy": 0.768914447888049, "semantic_similarity": 0.43173850344047915, "bleu_score": 0.0, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.13856812933025403, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.08608321377331421, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.35502958579881655}

Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign. Cackle Fever This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.” Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease is cured. Any event that causes the infected creature great stress-including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare-forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success. Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours. At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later. Sewer Plague Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs. When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected. It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest. At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease. Sight Rot This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim. A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal. Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely."], "response": "### 1. Putting *Sight Rot* into the 5E Ruleset\n\n| Item | What it Does | How to Play It |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Name** | *Sight Rot* (or “Eye‑Rot”/“The Blindening”) | Pick a memorable, evocative name. |\n| **Trigger** | Infected by contact, contaminated water, or a cursed item. | Make it a “disease” (DMG § 285). |\n| **Detection** | DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) or a DC 12 Constitution check to notice early symptoms (blurry vision, halos). | Allow NPCs and PCs to spot it before it worsens. |\n| **Progression** | 3‑stage disease: <br>1️⃣ **Early** – blurred vision, mild headaches. <br>2️⃣ **Mid** – partial loss (blindsight 10 ft. or 1 d4–1 visual impairment). <br>3️⃣ **Late** – total blindness (blindness). | After each night, the infected makes a DC 12 Con save.

The PCs must solve riddles or fight guardians to reach it. | The Glade is watched by a **blind sage** who claims the flower can *awaken* those who have lost sight permanently. |\n| **Cure Requires Knowledge** | The herb must be processed by a **herbalist** with a *Knowledge (Nature)* check (DC 15). Without it, the potion only slows progression. | The herbalist demands a **sacrifice**: a personal memory, or a small creature to be “cleared” (difficult to justify). |\n| **Eyebright as a Currency** | Rare and expensive; merchants hoard it.

{"user_input": "what does greater restoration do to madness?", "reference_contexts": ["Madness In a typical campaign, characters aren’t driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face. Going Mad Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them. Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. Madness Effects Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness. A character afflicted with short-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes. A character afflicted with long-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours. A character afflicted with indefinite madnessgains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured. Short --Term Madness d100 Effect (lasts 1d10 min utes) 01 - 20 The character retreats into his or her mind and becomes paralyzed. The effect ends if the character takes any damage. 21-30 The character becomes incapacitated and spends the duration screaming, laughing, or weeping. 31 - 40 The character becomes frightened and must use his or her action and movement each round to flee from the source of the fear. 41-50 The character begins babbling and is incapable of normal speech or spellcasting. 51 - 60 The character must use his or her action each round to attack the nearest creature. 61 - 70 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks. 71 - 75 The character does whatever anyone tells him or her to do that isn’t obviously self -- destructive. 76 - 80 The character experiences an overpowering urge to eat something strange such as dirt, slime, or offal. 81 - 90 The character is stunned. 91 - 100 The character falls unconscious. Long--Term Madness d100 Effect (lasts 1d10 × 10 hours) 01-10 The character feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting coins. 11-20 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks. 21-30 The character suffers extreme paranoia. Th e character has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks. 31-40 The character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell. 41-45 The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects. 46-55 The character becomes attached to a “lucky charm,” such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it. 56 - 65 The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%). 66-75 The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that in vo lve Strength or Dexterity. 76-85 The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn’t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took e ffect. 86 - 90 Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute. 91-95 The character loses the ability to speak. 96-100 The character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or damage can wake the character.

The more serious the situation, the funnier I find it.” 96-100 “I’ve discovered that I really like killing people.” Curing Madness A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness."], "response": "**Short answer:** Greater Restoration does **not** explicitly cure madness.\n\n---\n\n### What the spell actually says\n\n*Greater Restoration* (PHB, 279) reads:\n\n> “You imbue a creature you touch with a burst of pure energy, **ending one of the following effects on the target**:\n> \n> * a curse,\n> * a reduction of the target’s ability scores,\n> * a reduction in the target’s hit points,\n> * or a condition such as **charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned**.”\n> *You also reduce exhaustion by one level.*\n\nThe list is explicit; madness is **not** among the conditions listed. Therefore, by RAW (Rules As Written), Greater Restoration does not cure madness.\n\n---\n\n### How madness is defined\n\n- In the *Dungeon Master’s Guide* (p. 292), “madness” is presented as an optional condition that can arise from curses, supernatural encounters, or certain monsters. It is **not** one of the core conditions enumerated in the PHB.\n\n- Because it is not a core condition, it is not automatically removed by spells that list specific conditions.\n\n---\n\n### What a DM can decide\n\n- **If the madness is caused by a curse**: The spell’s “ending a curse” clause may remove the underlying curse, which might indirectly end the madness. Some DMs rule that Greater Restoration removes *any* effect caused by a curse, including madness.\n\n- **If the madness is not a curse**: The spell has no effect on it, and a DM would need to use other means (e.g., a custom spell, a powerful healer, or a narrative solution) to cure it.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- *By the official rules, Greater Restoration does **not** cure madness.*  \n- A DM has the discretion to interpret a curse‑induced madness as a removable effect, but that is a house‑rule decision, not an official effect of the spell.", "reference": "A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.

{"user_input": "I read about Adamantine in the rules but i dont get it, can you explain how hard it is to hit an Adamantine object, what AC it has, and how it compares to other materials like iron or steel, and if it has any special properties like resistances or vulnerabilities?", "reference_contexts": ["Objects When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire’s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character’s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does. For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects. Statistics for Objects When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage. Armor Class. An object’s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances. Object Armor Class Substance AC Cloth, paper, rope 11 Crystal, glass, ice 13 Wood, bone 15 Stone 17 Iron, steel 19 Mithral 21 Adamantine 23 Hit Points. An object’s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller. Object Hit Points Size Fragile Resilient Tiny (bottle, lock) 2 (1d4) 5 (2d4) Small (chest, lute) 3 (1d6) 10 (3d6) Medium (barrel, chandelier) 4 (1d8) 18 (4d8) Large (cart, 10 --ft.--by--10--ft. window) 5 (1d10) 27 (5d10) Huge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquakespell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object’s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points. Objects and Damage Types.Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can’t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment. Damage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hit points."], "response": "**Adamantine in 5 e**  \n(“Materials” – DMG p. 215‑218)\n\n| Property | Adamantine | Iron/Steel |\n|----------|------------|------------|\n| **Object AC** | 22 | 16 |\n| **Hardness** | Same as steel (≈18) | 18 |\n| **Damage resistance** | Non‑magical weapons do **not** damage an adamantine object unless the weapon’s damage is **≥ the object’s hardness** (or it is a magical weapon). | Non‑magical weapons that deal 15 + damage can damage it. |\n| **Special effects on weapons** | +1d4 damage; on a critical hit the extra damage is doubled (so 2×1d4). | No special effect. |\n| **Vulnerabilities** | None. | None. |\n\n### How “hard” is Adamantine?\n\n* **AC 22** – A standard attack needs a +7 or higher bonus to hit a 22‑AC object.  \n  For comparison, a steel or iron object is AC 16, so Adamantine is 6 points harder.  \n  Because it’s an object, the AC is the same regardless of the creature’s size or the weapon type (though large or extra‑large objects are treated as normal size for the AC calculation).\n\n* **Damage resistance** – A non‑magical attack dealing, say, 12 damage cannot break an adamantine item, whereas it would break a steel item.  \n  Only a magical weapon, a weapon of equal or greater damage, or an attack that actually applies damage equal to the item’s hardness can damage it.  \n  This makes Adamantine a go‑to material for important items (e.g., a critical‑strike shield, a key, or a magic sword’s core).\n\n### Comparison to other common metals\n\n| Material | Object AC | Special property |\n|----------|-----------|------------------|\n| **Steel/iron** | 16 | No special effect |\n| **Adamantine** | 22 | +1d4 damage on weapons; double that on crits; cannot be damaged by non‑magical weapons unless the damage is ≥ hardness |\n\n### Quick checklist\n\n1. **Hit Chance** – Treat Adamantine objects as if they had AC 22.  \n2. **Damage** – Non‑magical attacks that would normally hit (e.g., a +5 longsword dealing 10 damage) *do not* damage Adamantine unless the damage is ≥ the hardness (≈18).  \n3. **Magical weapons** – Any magical weapon can damage Adamantine normally.  \n4. **Weapons made of Adamantine** – Add +1d4 damage; on a crit, double the extra damage.  \n5. **No extra vulnerabilities** – Adamantine has no built‑in weaknesses (unless your DM gives it one as a house rule).\n\n**Bottom line:** Adamantine is the toughest common material in 5 e.

The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save. Inhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body. Injury.

Cantrips At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. Wild Shape Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.

As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious. •You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transformingdoesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’vealready cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast. •You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.However, you can’t use any of your special senses,such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. •You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form,or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment,based on the creature’s shape and size. Yourequipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. Druid Circle At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Timeless Body Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Beast Spells Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components. Archdruid At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape. Circle of the Land The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites. Bonus Cantrip When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. Natural Recovery Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. Circle Spells Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

When"], "response": "**Druidic Focus (PHB, p. 145)**  \n- *Definition*: A druidic focus is “a wooden or natural item that can be used as a spell‑casting focus.”  \n- *Function*: A druid may use the focus in place of a material component for any spell that **does not** require a specific named material or a component of a particular cost.  \n- *No restriction on the type of wood*: It can be a staff, a twig, a small wooden bowl, a carved figurine, etc. The only requirement is that it is a natural (or wooden) object that the druid is comfortable handling.  \n- *Holy symbol*: A druid can also use a holy symbol as a spell‑casting focus (if they belong to a Circle that allows it, e.g., the Circle of the Land). The focus and the holy symbol are separate items.\n\n**Can a druid use a druidic focus?**  \nYes. The rules explicitly state that a druid can use a druidic focus as a spell‑casting focus. It functions just like a spell‑casting focus for other classes: it allows the druid to cast spells that would otherwise need a material component.\n\n**Druidic Language vs. Druidic Focus**  \n- *Druidic Language* is a secret, symbolic language used by druids for rituals, communication, and to invoke certain nature spirits.  \n- It is **not** a requirement for creating or using a focus. You can inscribe druidic runes on a focus for flavor, but the rules do not tie the language to the focus’s function. The focus is an object, not a spoken or written form.\n\n**Equipment Restrictions for a Druidic Focus**  \n1. **Material**: Must be natural or wooden. Metal, stone, or other non‑natural materials do not qualify.  \n2. **Size & Practicality**: It should be a manageable size (staff, twig, bowl, etc.). The DM can rule that something too heavy or unwieldy is impractical.  \n3. **Cost**: No special cost is required; it can be a mundane piece of wood or a simple crafted object.  \n4. **Special Items**: Nothing in the rules mandates that a focus be from a “sacred” plant or wood, though many druids choose items from trees that hold personal or cultural significance (e.g., yew, oak, elder). This is purely flavor.\n\n**Relation to Sacred Plants & Woods**  \nThe PHB does not list specific “sacred plants” that must be used. It merely states the focus is a natural item. If a campaign setting gives a druid a “sacred plant” or a wood with special properties (e.g., the wood of a druidic grove), a DM can allow it as the focus and possibly grant a minor flavor bonus. Otherwise, any natural wooden object is acceptable.\n\n**Bottom line**  \n- A druidic focus is a wooden/natural object that can serve as a spell‑casting focus for all druid spells that need a material component.  \n- Druidic language is unrelated to the focus; it is a separate communication system.  \n- The focus must be natural or wooden; otherwise it’s just an arbitrary choice of flavor for your character.  \n- Sacred plants or woods can be used if your DM allows it, but they’re not required by RAW.", "reference": "According to the equipment section of the druid class features, a druid starts with a \"druidic focus\" as part of their equipment (see the list that includes a wooden shield or any simple weapon, a scimitar or any simple melee weapon, leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus).  The spellcasting section states that a druid can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for their druid spells (see the paragraph that reads, \"You can use a druidic focus (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells\").  This focus is not limited to metal; druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal, and the focus is typically made from natural materials such as oak, yew, alder, or other sacred woods.  The druidic focus also ties into the druidic language, which is the secret language of druids; it can be used to leave hidden messages that only those who know the language can decipher.  Thus, the druidic focus serves both as a physical tool for spellcasting and as a symbolic link to the druidic language and the sacred plants that druids use to craft their tools.", "answer_relevancy": 0.6097707895155133, "semantic_similarity": 0.44570612584496727, "bleu_score": 0.04202042584916016, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.19858156028368795, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.13671875, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.3626943005181347}

For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Beast Spells Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components. Archdruid At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape. Circle of the Land The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites. Bonus Cantrip When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. Natural Recovery Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. Circle Spells Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid.

You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entanglespell. Nature’s Ward When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. Nature’s Sanctuary When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC.On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses.On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. Sacred Plants and Wood A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. Druids and the Gods Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix PH--B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples."], "response": "**Wild Shape – Core rules**\n\n| Feature | What it does (PHB / XGtE) | Key interactions |\n|---------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| **Hit‑point handling** | • While you are a beast you use the beast’s hit‑point pool.<br>• When you **revert** to your normal form you regain any hit points you lost while Wild‑Shaped (you can’t exceed your normal maximum).<br>• If you drop to 0 HP in beast form you can’t revert and you die unless you are stabilized. | *Recovery* is simply “back to your normal hit‑point total”; it doesn’t change the number of hit‑points you can recover after reverting. |\n| **Equipment** | • On transformation you lose the use of any equipment that requires a free hand (or that you can’t physically wield in that form).<br>• Your *normal* gear “merges” with the beast (you keep it in your inventory and can put it back on when you revert).<br>• A component pouch or a spellcasting focus that is part of your inventory **can** be used in beast form even if the beast has no hands, because the rules treat the pouch/focus as a “stored” item rather than a held item. | You can’t wield a sword if the beast has no hands, but you can still use a *component pouch* to supply material components. |\n| **20th‑level Wild Shape (Improved)** | • You can **cast spells while Wild‑Shaped**.<br>• You can use the normal **verbal (V) and somatic (S)** components of spells; the rules explicitly say you may ignore those components in beast form.<br>• Material (M) components still apply; you need the component itself or a component pouch. | At 20th level a druid can cast any spell that *doesn’t* require a special material component that can’t be replaced or is consumed and that the druid doesn’t possess. |\n\n---\n\n### 1. Hit‑point recovery & Wild Shape\n\n- While in beast form, you **cannot** recover hit points by resting in the usual way (you are still subject to the beast’s hit‑point pool).  \n- When you **revert**, you “snap back” to your normal hit‑point total, automatically regaining whatever you lost while Wild‑Shaped.  \n- The rule is **not** “gain hit points while Wild‑Shaped”; you only recover when you return to your own form.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Equipment handling & material components\n\n| Scenario | What you can do | Why |\n|----------|-----------------|-----|\n| **No hands in beast** | Cannot wield weapons or use items that require a hand. | PHB §67 “You can’t use any item that requires a hand.” |\n| **Component pouch present** | Can use it to supply M components of any spell. | A component pouch is a “stored” item; it can be used even without hands. |\n| **Specific material component** | Must have the component in your inventory or the spell must be “free.” | The spell’s M component is not replaced by a pouch. |\n| **20th‑level druid** | Can ignore V & S, but M components still apply unless you have a component pouch. | The “Improved Wild Shape” feature only removes the verbal and somatic requirements. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Circle of the Land spells that require V & S\n\n- **Before 20th level** – you **cannot** cast any spell that has V or S while Wild‑Shaped, even if you have a component pouch.  \n- **At 20th level** – you may cast them because you are allowed to ignore V & S in beast form.  \n- **Material components** – remain a requirement; you need the component or a pouch.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Interaction with other Druid class features\n\n| Feature | How it behaves in beast form |\n|---------|-----------------------------|\n| **Land’s Stride** | Still applies (you can move through nonmagical difficult terrain), but the movement speed is limited to the beast’s speed. |\n| **Nature’s Ward** | The ward was cast before you Wild‑Shaped, so it remains active. It does **not** require the druid to be in a particular form or to maintain concentration. |\n| **Nature’s Sanctuary** | Same as Nature’s Ward; the protective effect continues regardless of your current form. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Character‑creation equipment choices & spellcasting while Wild‑Shaped\n\n- **Component pouch** – Highly recommended if you plan to cast spells that need material components while Wild‑Shaped.  \n- **Druidic focus** – Useful if you want to cast spells that require a focus and you are a 20th‑level druid who can ignore S.  \n- **Weapon** – If you plan to fight in beast form, pick a beast that can use the weapon’s damage type (e.g., a bear that can use a club). Remember you cannot wield it unless you have the hands.  \n- **Light** – If you want to maintain a light source in beast form, use a light source that doesn’t require hands (e.g., a lantern on a strap).  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n1. **Hit‑points**: Revert to normal form to regain lost hit‑points.  \n2. **Equipment**: You lose the use of items that need a hand, but you still possess them and can use a component pouch for M components.  \n3. **Spellcasting**: 20th‑level druid can cast V & S spells in beast form; M components still apply unless you have a pouch.  \n4. **Class features**: Land’s Stride, Nature’s Ward, and Nature’s Sanctuary remain active in beast form; their effects are not tied to your physical form.  \n5. **Creation choices**: Pick a component pouch (and possibly a focus) if you want to keep spellcasting versatility while Wild‑Shaped.  \n\nWith these rules in mind you can design a druid that keeps its spellcasting potency even while morphing into a mighty beast.", "reference": "According to the Wild Shape rules in the first context, when a Druid reverts to normal form they return to the hit points they had before transforming. If the revert is caused by dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to the normal form. For example, taking 10 damage in animal form with only 1 hit point left causes a revert and the Druid takes 9 damage in normal form; as long as that excess damage does not reduce the normal form to 0, the Druid is not knocked unconscious. The rules also state that while in beast form the Druid cannot cast spells that require hands or speech, but they can still perform somatic and verbal components of spells they have already cast, and they retain any class features that are physically possible in the new form. Equipment handling is governed by the choice to let it fall, merge, or be worn. Worn equipment functions normally, but the GM decides if it is practical for the beast. Equipment that cannot be worn must either fall or merge; merged equipment has no effect until the Druid leaves the beast form.\n\nAt 18th level, the Druid gains the Beast Spells feature, allowing them to cast many druid spells while in any shape. They can perform somatic and verbal components in beast form, but cannot provide material components. At 20th level, the Archdruid feature lets the Druid ignore verbal and somatic components of druid spells, and also ignore material components that lack a cost and are not consumed. This means that Circle of the Land spells that normally require verbal or somatic components can be cast in beast form without those components, and material components that are free or non‑consumable can also be ignored. However, if a spell requires a material component that has a cost or is consumed, the Druid would still need to provide it, unless the equipment that would normally supply it is merged and therefore unavailable.\n\nThe Druid’s class features such as Land’s Stride, Nature’s Ward, and Nature’s Sanctuary are retained while in beast form as long as the new form is physically capable of using them. For example, Land’s Stride allows the Druid to move through non‑magical difficult terrain without extra cost, and Nature’s Ward provides immunity to poison and disease, both of which remain active in beast form. The equipment choices made at character creation—such as a wooden shield, a simple weapon, leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus—are subject to the same merge/fall/wear rules, so a druidic focus that is merged into the beast form cannot be used to provide a material component until the Druid leaves the form.\n\nIn summary, Wild Shape affects hit point recovery by restoring the pre‑transform hit points and carrying over excess damage, limits spellcasting to somatic and verbal components unless the Druid is an Archdruid, and requires careful consideration of equipment handling to determine whether material components can be supplied while in beast form. The Circle of the Land spells are fully usable in beast form under these rules, with component requirements waived at 20th level, but the availability of material components still depends on whether the necessary equipment is worn or merged.", "answer_relevancy": 0.720816167154125, "semantic_similarity": 0.8998513866108171, "bleu_score": 0.027169295928672108, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.1970853573907009, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.15990990990990991, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.25678119349005424}

Preparing and Casting Spells The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (see “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. Wild Shape Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed. Beast Shapes Level Max.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: •Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment,personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, andCharisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’sbonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them. •When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice.

Language and Wild Shape\n\n| Feature | What it says | How it interacts with Wild Shape |\n|---------|--------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Druidic** | A language that only druids (and a few other classes) know. | *The spell Wild Shape does not change your knowledge of any language.* You keep speaking Druidic, reading it, and writing it whether you’re in humanoid or beast form. |\n| **Wild Shape (PHB, p. 66)** | “You can use your action to transform into a beast.” | The spell’s description does not strip you of language skills.  You’re still a druid, mentally, so you can speak.  Only the *physical* aspects of the beast (hands, eyes, etc.) matter for holding items. |\n| **Wild Shape (Improved – 18th‑level)** | “Starting at 18th level, you can use Wild Shape again as a spell.” | You still can’t cast spells that require material components you don’t have while transformed.  The 18th‑level feature simply lets you spend a spell slot to change back and forth again. |\n\n*Bottom line:* A druid in beast form still “knows” Druidic.  The spell doesn’t remove that knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Spellcasting & Material Components\n\n| Rule | What it means for a beast‑form druid |\n|------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Spells with a spoken component** (PHB, p. 202) | You utter the word(s) in the language you know.  Druidic is fine; the only requirement is that you can speak it. |\n| **Material components** (PHB, p. 202) | A material component must be present in the caster’s possession.  If the beast has no hands, it can’t *hold* a component.  It can *wear* it or keep it on its belt, however, so that’s acceptable. |\n| **Can’t cast spells while Wild‑Shaped** (PHB, p. 66) | The spell says “You can’t cast spells while transformed.”  The only exception is for spells that have no material component *or* a component that is a **focus** that you can carry (e.g., a druidic focus).  The druid can still use a focus, because it’s a *material component that doesn’t cost anything* and can be carried on the body. |\n| **Spellcasting while in beast form** (Sage Advice) | “A druid can cast a spell while in Wild Shape only if the spell has no material component.”  The 18th‑level spell‑slot Wild Shape doesn’t change that. |\n\n**Druidic focus in beast form**\n\n* The focus is a *material component* (PHB, p. 202).  \n* It must be physically present, but it doesn’t need to be held in a hand.  A druid can attach it to a belt, necklace, or even a pelt, so it’s available even when the beast has no hands.  \n* If the druid can’t keep the focus on the beast (e.g., the focus is a small wand that the beast can’t hold), the druid can’t use it in that form.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Hidden Messages & Language\n\n| Scenario | How Druidic helps/doesn’t help |\n|----------|--------------------------------|\n| **Speaking a secret** | A druid speaking Druidic to a non‑druid is essentially speaking in a language the listener can’t understand.  That’s not “magically hidden”; it’s simply a language barrier.  The DM can decide whether a listener can guess or use an *Intelligence (Investigation)* check to learn the meaning. |\n| **Writing a hidden message** | Writing in Druidic is only hidden from those who don’t know the language.  There’s no special rule that makes it a “secret” in the sense of *Detect Secret* or *Identify*.  The DM can treat it as a normal secret writing that requires knowledge of the language. |\n| **Use of a Druidic focus** | The focus is a *material component*, not a language.  It doesn’t influence whether a message is hidden.  A druid in beast form can still use the focus if it’s physically present. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Recap & Key Take‑aways\n\n1. **Language knowledge is unaffected** by Wild Shape.  A druid in beast form can still speak, read, and write Druidic.  \n2. **Spellcasting in beast form** is still limited to spells with no material components (or a focus that the druid can keep on the beast).  The 18th‑level spell‑slot Wild Shape doesn’t grant the ability to cast arbitrary spells while transformed.  \n3. **Druidic focus** can be used while in beast form if it’s carried on the body.  The beast must be able to keep the focus in its possession; no hands are strictly required.  \n4. **Hidden messages** written or spoken in Druidic are “hidden” only because the audience doesn’t know the language.  The rules for secret messages do not change.\n\nIf you want to double‑check the exact wording for the 18th‑level Wild Shape (the “Improved” version), you can consult the *5e SRD* or *PHB*:\n\n> **Wild Shape (Improved).** *Starting at 18th level, you can use Wild Shape again as a spell.*  \n> (Sage Advice: The spell still obeys the rule that you can’t cast spells with material components you lack while transformed.)\n\nFeel free to let me know if you’d like a deeper dive into any specific rule or a DM‑friendly way to handle hidden messages in Druidic.", "reference": "At 18th level a druid gains the Beast Spells feature, which lets them cast many druid spells while in any Wild Shape. The rules state that while in beast form the druid can perform the somatic and verbal components of a spell, but cannot provide material components. This means that a druid can still speak Druidic (the secret language) while in beast form, because speaking is a verbal action. The Druidic language rules say that anyone who knows Druidic automatically spots a hidden message written in it, and others can detect its presence with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but cannot decipher it without magic. Thus, a druid can leave a hidden Druidic message in beast form, and other druids will spot it instantly, while non‑druids will only notice the presence.\n\nEquipment rules for Wild Shape say that a druid may choose whether equipment falls, merges, or is worn. Equipment that merges has no effect until the druid leaves the form. Because the druid’s equipment does not change size or shape to match the beast, any gear that the beast cannot wear must either fall or merge. Therefore, while in beast form a druid cannot use a weapon or armor that the beast cannot physically hold or wear, even though the druid retains the ability to cast spells.\n\nThe ability to speak Druidic is not limited by the beast form; the rules explicitly allow verbal components in beast form. However, the druid cannot provide material components unless the beast form can hold them. The Archdruid feature at 20th level removes the need for verbal and somatic components entirely, so a 20th‑level druid could cast a spell in beast form without speaking Druidic at all.\n\nIn summary: a druid can speak Druidic while Wild‑shaped, can leave hidden messages that other druids spot instantly, can cast spells that require verbal components (but not material components unless the beast can hold them), and equipment that merges with the beast form is inert until the druid reverts.", "answer_relevancy": 0.7515363352877719, "semantic_similarity": 0.4793169103979629, "bleu_score": 0.07955891555490757, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.17705927636643573, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.11966701352757544, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.34023668639053256}

If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background. Suggested Characteristics A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation. Customizing a Background You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one. Acolyte You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power. Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny. Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion Languages: Two of your choice Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp Feature: Shelter of the Faithful As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple. Suggested Characteristics Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme. d8 Personality Trait 1 I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example. 2 I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. 3 I see omens in every event and action.

Equipment Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer’s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s rest in a poor inn. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot. Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell. Magic Items.Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such. Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first. Trade Goods.On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods-bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on-retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency. Armor Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield. The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds. Armor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells. Armor Class (AC).Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class. Heavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score. Stealth. If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Shields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time. Light Armor Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class. Padded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting. Leather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class. Hide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor. Chain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers. Scale Mail.This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets. Breastplate.This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered. Half Plate.Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps. Heavy Armor Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative. Ring Mail.This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor. Chain Mail.Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets. Splint.This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints. Plate.Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring. The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance. Weapon Proficiency Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

It was light enough to be worn by squires and low‑rank soldiers.\n- **Breastplate**: A single breast‑plate of steel or iron, often with a backplate. Popular among early‑modern soldiers and knights who sought protection without sacrificing too much agility.\n- **Scale Mail**: Constructed of metal scales sewn to a backing; offers high AC but limits movement. Early examples were leather‑backed and later turned to steel for better protection.\n- **Half‑Plate**: The “first true plate” armor; consists of a breastplate and backplate with articulated plates on shoulders and hips. It was expensive and reserved for high‑ranking knights.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Gameplay Mechanics\n\n1. **Armor Class (AC)**  \n   - Adds the armor’s base AC + your Dexterity modifier (max +2).  \n   - Example: A ranger wearing a breastplate with Dex +3 gets `14 + 3 = 17 AC`.\n\n2. **Strength Requirement**  \n   - You must have at least 13 Strength to wear chain shirt, breastplate, scale mail, or half‑plate.  \n   - *Effect*: If you fail the Strength check, you can’t benefit from the armor’s AC and you must take a –1 penalty to melee attacks that rely on Strength (e.g., *sword* checks).  \n\n3. **Stealth**  \n   - Medium armor imposes a disadvantage on Stealth checks. *Exception: Heavy armor and Shield*.  \n\n4. **Weight & Encumbrance**  \n   - The table above lists typical weights. Medium armor usually falls into the “light” to “medium” encumbrance category.  \n\n5. **Class Interaction**  \n   - Many classes (paladin, fighter, ranger) are proficient with medium armor.  \n   - Clerics or warlocks may use it if they acquire the proficiency from feats or backgrounds.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Flavor & Narrative Use\n\n| Situation | How to describe wearing the armor | How it informs role‑playing | Tips |\n|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------|\n| **Entering a tavern** | “The guard’s chain shirt clinked as he checked the entrance, its polished rings reflecting the low light.” | Shows status (guard, knight, mercenary). | Use *polished* vs *rusted* to hint at maintenance. |\n| **In battle** | “He cut through the enemy ranks, his half‑plate flashing in the torchlight.” | Emphasizes protection and mobility. | Mention *breath‑sustaining* or *restricting* the motion. |\n| **Training** | “She practiced sword‑play, her breastplate limiting her reach but teaching her to fight with precision.” | Highlights the trade‑off between protection and finesse. | Include *muscle fatigue* if the armor is heavy. |\n| **Stealth mission** | “The rogue slid beneath the courtyard, her breastplate clanking on the stone, the sound betraying her position.” | Shows narrative consequences of the disadvantage on Stealth. | Use the clank as a dramatic cue. |\n\n#### Narrative Techniques\n\n1. **Sensory Detail**  \n   - *Sound*: Clanking, rustling, a metal whisper.  \n   - *Sight*: Gleaming, dented, ornate heraldic embossing.  \n   - *Feel*: Cold, weighty, the snug fit.\n\n2. **Symbolism**  \n   - Heavy armor can symbolize duty, chivalry, or oppression.  \n   - Lightness can represent agility, rebellion, or a tactical advantage.\n\n3. **Character Interaction**  \n   - *Armor as identity*: A paladin’s breastplate bearing a sigil; a mercenary’s patched half‑plate.  \n   - *Maintenance*: Scenes of a blacksmith, the scent of oil, or a warrior polishing his armor.\n\n4. **Consequences**  \n   - Armor weight can fatigue a character, causing *Fatigue* or a *concentration* penalty.  \n   - Losing an armor piece in combat can be dramatic (shattering a breastplate or a broken chain shirt).  \n\n5. **Cultural Flavor**  \n   - Mention cultural references: “The knight’s breastplate bore the crest of the House of Lumin.”  \n   - Different cultures may use different styles: *Eastern samurai* use *do* (full armor) but in D&D you can adapt the same idea.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Example Scenes\n\n| Scene | Character | Armor | Narrative Hook |\n|-------|-----------|-------|----------------|\n| **Siege of Castle Blackthorn** | Sir Aldren (Paladin) | Half‑plate, polished | *His armor gleamed, a mirror to the sun, while his shield whispered of past victories.* |\n| **Bandit Ambush** | Lira (Ranger) | Breastplate, weather‑worn | *The breastplate’s dented edges told of many fights; it sang a song of survival.* |\n| **Training Camp** | Tharok (Fighter) | Scale Mail | *Scale mail clinked as Tharok advanced, each step a note in a symphony of steel.* |\n| **Dungeon Crawl** | Vex (Rogue) | Chain Shirt | *Vex slipped in the chain shirt’s narrow gaps, her stealth clashing with the armor’s inherent clank.* |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Using Medium Armor in Storytelling\n\n1. **Define Class Identity**  \n   - A paladin’s breastplate can be a relic of a holy order.  \n   - A ranger’s chain shirt may be dyed with forest green to blend with surroundings, giving a *tactical* narrative.\n\n2. **Show Character Growth**  \n   - A novice squire starts with a simple chain shirt; after a major victory he earns a half‑plate.  \n\n3. **Introduce Conflict**  \n   - An armor shortage forces the party to improvise: leather cuirasses, improvised shields, or a broken chain shirt.\n\n4. **Use as Plot Device**  \n   - *The lost breastplate of the King* becomes a quest: retrieve it before enemies use it to gain legitimacy.  \n\n5. **Cultural Commentary**  \n   - In a world where certain societies view armor as a symbol of tyranny, wearing it might carry political risk.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Quick Reference Cheat Sheet\n\n| Armor | AC | Dex cap | Stealth | Strength | Weight |\n|-------|----|--------|---------|----------|--------|\n| Chain Shirt | 13 | +2 | – | 13 | 20 lb |\n| Breastplate | 14 | +2 | – | 13 | 20 lb |\n| Scale Mail | 14 | +2 | – | 13 | 40 lb |\n| Half‑Plate | 15 | +2 | – | 13 | 55 lb |\n\n*All are **medium**: give +1 to AC if you are level 1 and wearing the armor, **no proficiency bonus** is added automatically; it depends on class proficiency.*\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Medium armor strikes a balance between protection and mobility. It’s accessible to most martial classes, offers flavorful descriptions, and can be woven into plot, culture, and character development. Use it to emphasize status, showcase a character’s training, or even create narrative tension when resources are scarce.

{"user_input": "what damage improvised weapon does if no resemblance to weapon and what range improvised thrown weapon?", "reference_contexts": ["from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way. Finesse.When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Heavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively. Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Loading. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range. Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. Special. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section). Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack. Improvised Weapons Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Silvered Weapons Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective. Special Weapons Weapons with special rules are described here. Lance.You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted. Net.A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Fighters, paladins, barbarians, and many other classes are automatically proficient.\n\n2. **Attack Roll**  \n   Add your Strength modifier (or Dexterity if you have a “finesse” version, though the standard PHB rule does not provide one).  \n   Example: Strength 16 (+3). Attack roll = d20 + proficiency bonus + 3.\n\n3. **Damage**  \n   Roll 1d10 and add the same Strength modifier.  \n   Example: 1d10 + 3.\n\n4. **Reach**  \n   The glaive’s reach is 10 ft. You can strike enemies up to 10 ft away, giving you a tactical advantage over short‑range weapons.\n\n5. **Shield Rule**  \n   Because it has reach, you cannot hold a shield while wielding a glaive. If you need a shield, switch to a weapon without reach (e.g., longsword).\n\n6. **Special Feats**  \n   *Polearm Master* (Xanathar’s Guide to Everything) allows you to make a bonus action opportunity attack when an enemy enters your reach.  \n   *Sentinel* (Player’s Handbook) can be combined with *Polearm Master* to stop enemies moving within your reach.\n\n7. **Other Uses**  \n   Some DMG or home‑brew rules allow a glaive to be thrown (range 20 ft), but this is not standard in 5E. If you want to use a glaive as a thrown weapon, check with your DM.\n\n### Quick Takeaway\n\n- The glaive is a **polearm** that lets you attack **10 ft away**.  \n- It deals **1d10 slashing damage** and requires a **Strength‑based attack roll**.  \n- You cannot use a shield with it.  \n- It’s a standard martial weapon; any class proficient in martial weapons can wield it.\n\nIf you meant something other than the polearm (e.g., a custom item or class feature named “Glaiv”), let me know and I can dive into that specifically!", "reference": "A glaive is a 20‑gp, 1d10 slashing weapon that weighs 6 lb.

Acid. As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage. Alchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. Antitoxin.A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs. Arcane Focus.An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item-designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus. Ball Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift. Book. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section). Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Case, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts. Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment. Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor. Component Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description). Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied. Druidic Focus.A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus. Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield. Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot. Hunting Trap.

It cannot be used by another creature unless that creature drinks it. | • Cannot be applied to a creature that hasn’t drunk it.  <br>• Not a spell or area effect; it’s a consumable that acts only on the drinker. |\n| 4 | **Duration** | None beyond the single save or death‑save. The advantage disappears after the first relevant saving throw. | • No ongoing effect after that. |\n| 5 | **Exclusions** | • Does **not** work against diseases or magical effects that are not poison/ toxin.  <br>• Does not remove the poisoned or toxin condition.  <br>• Does not affect damage from a poison (e.g., poison that deals damage each round). | • If a poison has “toxin” in its description, the death‑save benefit applies; otherwise only the next regular save is affected. |\n| 6 | **Cost‑efficiency** | One vial per use; typically purchased in bulk or found as loot. | • If a creature has multiple poisons or toxins over time, it must drink multiple vials.  <br>• The vial is not a free or “auto‑cure” item—advantage is contingent on a successful save. |\n\n---\n\n#### Bottom line\nAn Antitoxin vial is a single‑use consumable that grants **advantage** on the **next** saving throw (or death‑saving throw) against poison or toxin for the creature that drinks it.

A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius. Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices. Magnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed. Manacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points. Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl. Oil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. Poison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. Potion of Healing. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action. Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check. Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts. Rope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check. Scale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth. Spellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells. Spyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two. Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute. Torch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

Below is a quick cheat sheet on how to weave it into your narrative, with the mechanics you’ll need to keep the game running smoothly.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What it Does (Rules Snapshot)\n\n| Property | Detail |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Damage** | 1d6 poison damage |\n| **Saving Throw** | DC 10 Constitution (the target can attempt a Con save to halve damage) |\n| **Target** | Any living creature, or any object (weapon, drink, rope, etc.) |\n| **Duration** | Instantaneous (apply once, effect happens immediately) |\n| **Storage** | Small vial; keeps for 24 h in a cool place.  If left exposed to the elements it can lose potency (DM’s discretion). |\n\n> **Tip:** If you want a higher‑stakes poison, look at *Advanced Poison* (1d8 damage, DC 12) or *Potent Poison* (1d10, DC 14). *Basic Poison* is great for a subtle threat or a “just‑enough‑to‑slow‑them‑down” moment.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How to Apply It\n\n| Scenario | Application | Narrative Hook |\n|----------|-------------|----------------|\n| **On a weapon** | Drip it onto a blade or arrowhead. The poisoned item must be struck for the poison to work. | “The assassin uncorks the vial, letting the amber liquid drip onto his dagger’s edge, slick as a snake’s hide.” |\n| **In a drink** | Drop it in a goblet or cup. The victim drinks the tainted liquid. | “The king’s banquet is interrupted when a silver goblet is slipped from the waiter’s hand—inside it, a single drop of green‑ish poison.” |\n| **On a rope or trap** | Apply it to a rope used in a trap or to a rope you want to weaken. | “When the thieves slipped the rope into the catacomb, they’d already laced it with poison, turning the climb into a fight against time.” |\n\n> **Rule nuance:** The poison applies instantly when the target is *hit* (weapon) or *consumed* (drink). If it’s on a rope that’s then *struck* (e.g., pulled, swung) it triggers then.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Role‑Playing the Poison\n\n### 3.1. Setting the Stage\n\n- **Who carries it?**  \n  *An alchemist, a rogue, a necromancer, a disgruntled cook.* Pick a character whose motives fit the story: a spy, a traitor, a cursed guild.\n\n- **How do they get it?**  \n  *Purchased from a shady merchant.* *Crafted in a hidden laboratory.* *Found in the loot of a cursed lich.*\n\n- **Why use it?**  \n  *A quick way to incapacitate a guard.* *A signal to a secret society.* *A test of loyalty—those who refuse to accept the poison are the ones the plot will target.*\n\n### 3.2. Suspense & Consequences\n\n- **The “taste of fate” moment:** The poisoned drink is served. The victim swallows, and the world tilts: a 10‑Con save. Failure means 1d6 damage and a lingering sickness.  \n- **The poison’s subtlety:** The damage is low, so the character may not feel “poisoned” immediately. They could think they’re simply sick or injured, keeping the twist alive until the real effect kicks in.  \n- **Moral stakes:** A character might know the poison will harm innocents if they share it. The party’s decision to use or not use it can drive drama.\n\n### 3.3. Plot Hooks\n\n- **The Poisoned Letter:** A letter arrives with a faint residue of poison. Did the writer intend to kill the reader?  \n- **The Alchemist’s Dilemma:** The alchemist who made the poison wants it back—what happens when the party refuses?  \n- **The Poisoned Beast:** A creature is struck by a poisoned arrow and slowly turns on its allies—use the toxin to orchestrate a betrayal.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical Storytelling Tips\n\n1. **Show the Vial, Not Just the Damage**  \n   Describe the vial’s weight, the way the liquid glimmers, the sound of the cork popping. This tactile detail grounds the magic.\n\n2. **Use the Con Save as a Narrative Cue**  \n   Let the character make a Con check: a rolled 10 or higher = “You feel… faint, as if something inside you is turning.” Failure: “Your vision blurs. You’re… not going to make it.”\n\n3. **Let the Poison Be Part of the Environment**  \n   In a tavern, the poison can be left on a table where many guests will later taste it. In a dungeon, it can be placed on a rope to slow down a fleeing party.\n\n4. **Tie It to a Larger Arc**  \n   If the party is hunting a villain who “uses poison” as a trademark, the basic poison can be their “signature.” The players will know the smell or taste if they ever get close again.\n\n5. **Keep the Mechanics Light**  \n   The damage is modest, so it’s usually a “one‑shot” effect. If you need a bigger threat, upgrade to a stronger poison or combine it with a curse.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick Reference\n\n- **Damage**: 1d6  \n- **Save**: DC 10 Con (half damage on success)  \n- **Application**: Weapon hit, drink consumed, rope struck.  \n- **Storage**: 1 oz. vial, 24 h shelf life.  \n\nUse the poison to set tension, deliver a twist, or simply add a layer of danger to an otherwise routine encounter. With a little descriptive flair, *Poison, Basic* can become a memorable plot device—just as effective as the most elaborate spell.

Some DMs allow a “magic crystal” that grants a bonus or has a special effect, but that’s house‑rule. |\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Identify a spell that requires a material component**.  \n   Example: *mage hand* (no component), *dispel magic* (a diamond worth at least 100 gp), *speak with dead* (a bit of the victim’s hair).  \n2. **If you have an arcane focus**, you can use it instead of the material component, *provided the spell’s component is not a costly one that is explicitly listed as “non‑replaceable” (e.g., *dispel magic* requires a diamond worth at least 100 gp).*  \n3. **Cast the spell as normal**, using the focus as your material component.  \n4. **You don’t consume the focus** (unless the DM rules otherwise).\n\n### Is it a spell component?\n\n- It’s **not** a *material component* on its own.  \n- It’s a *substitute* that replaces the material component.  \n- Some spells say “a crystal worth 10 gp” (e.g., *magic missile* in older editions). In that case, you need a crystal with the stated value—this is a material component, not a focus.\n\n### Weight & Special Properties\n\n- A crystal focus is a small, solid object; most small crystals weigh a few pounds.  \n- It has **no inherent spell‑casting power**.  \n- The DM may allow a “magic crystal” that has a special property (e.g., extra spell slots, a small bonus to spell attack rolls, etc.), but that is not in the core rules.\n\n### Quick sanity check\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| *Do I need a crystal for every spell?* | Only for spells that list a material component. |\n| *Can I use any crystal?* | Yes, a crystal is a common type of focus. You can also use a wand, staff, or any object the DM deems appropriate. |\n| *Do I pay 10 gp each time I cast?* | No, you purchase the crystal once; it’s reusable. |\n| *Will it wear out?* | Only if the DM chooses to impose a condition. The core rules treat it as durable. |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** An *Arcane Focus (Crystal)* is a reusable item (usually bought for 10 gp) that lets you replace certain spell material components.

You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. Poison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. Potion of Healing. A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action. Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section). Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check. Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts. Rope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check. Scale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth. Spellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells. Spyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two. Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch-or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel-takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute. Torch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

(No spell‑casting or special conditions required.)\n\n---\n\n### How it plays out in the pressure‑plate/chain trap\n\n1. **Trigger** – Step on the plate.  \n   - The chain attaches, *restraining* you (you can’t move but you’re not unconscious).  \n   - The trap calls for a **DC 13 Dexterity saving throw** to avoid damage.\n\n2. **Saving Throw** – You roll.  \n   - **Success** – You avoid damage; the chain may still hold you.  \n   - **Failure** – You take the trap’s damage (usually 1d4 + 2 or as written). The chain remains in place.\n\n3. **Escape** – When you’re no longer restrained (by stepping off, breaking the chain, or a help action), you can act normally again.\n\n4. **Use the Potion**  \n   - **Timing**: Drinking the potion is an *action*.  \n   - **When to do it**: Once you’re freed and can use an action, drink the potion as a standard action on your turn.  \n   - **If still restrained**: You cannot drink the potion until you’re free, because the rules say “you must have a free hand to drink it” and you can’t use an action while restrained.  \n\n5. **Recovery** – After the potion is consumed, you instantly regain the hit points and can continue to move, fight, or set off another trap.\n\n---\n\n### Practical Tips\n\n- **Carry a potion** *before* entering any area that might have pressure plates or chains.  \n- If you’re trapped *and* you’re a caster or have an item that can break the chain (e.g., a short rope or a 2nd‑level spell like *Misty Step*), use it first, then drink the potion.  \n- If you have **two actions** (e.g., on a turn where you also free yourself with a 2‑action sequence), you can both free yourself and drink in the same round.  \n- Remember, the potion only restores HP; it does *not* grant any temporary hit points or cure conditions.\n\nIn short: After the trap’s Dexterity save (and any damage taken) and once you’re no longer restrained, use an action to drink the Potion of Healing and immediately regain 2d4 + 2 hit points.", "reference": "The Potion of Healing costs 50 gp and weighs ½ lb.

The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature. Lamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius. Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices. Magnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed. Manacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points. Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl. Oil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil.

As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage. Alchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. Antitoxin.A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs. Arcane Focus.An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item-designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus. Ball Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift. Book. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section). Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Case, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts. Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment. Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor. Component Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description). Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied. Druidic Focus.A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus. Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield. Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot. Hunting Trap.

In 5e the rules for a wizard, sorcerer, warlock, or any other arcane‑spellcasting class state that if a spell requires a material component that isn’t consumed, the caster may instead use an arcane focus *if they are allowed to do so*. A crystal qualifies because it can be treated as an orb, rod, or other focus in the PHB.\n\n- **Typical cost**  \n  The *Player’s Handbook* doesn’t list a fixed price for a focus, but the DMG’s list of mundane items gives a crystal a price of **10 gp** (weight ¼ lb). Because an arcane focus crystal is just a crystal used for spellcasting, most DMs set its price at **10 gp** unless they want to make it cheaper or more expensive for flavor or balance reasons.  \n\nSo, in practice: an arcane focus crystal is a crystal that serves as a focus for arcane spellcasting, and it normally costs **10 gp**.", "reference": "An Arcane focus Crystal is a crystal that can channel the power of arcane spells, and it costs 10 gp.", "answer_relevancy": 0.9536351218534644, "semantic_similarity": 0.8311986687718724, "bleu_score": 0.026676719129038632, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.1683168316831683, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.09340659340659341, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.85}

As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage. Alchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. Antitoxin.A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs. Arcane Focus.An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item-designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus. Ball Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift. Book. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section). Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Case, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts. Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment. Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor. Component Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description). Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied. Druidic Focus.A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus. Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting. Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield. Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot. Hunting Trap. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a"], "response": "**Price**\n\n- **Arcane Focus (crystal)** – 50 gp (1 lb.)  \n  *Source: PHB, Adventuring Gear table, p. 160.*\n\n**How it functions as a spellcasting focus**\n\n| Class | How the crystal is used | What it replaces | Rule reference |\n|-------|------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| **Sorcerer** | You may use the crystal as your **arcane focus**. | Material components that don’t have a cost (or that are “free” or “consumed”) that would otherwise need to be supplied in a component pouch. | PHB p. 145‑146 (arcane focus) |\n| **Wizard** | Same as for sorcerers: the crystal is an arcane focus. | Material components that are not consumed or have no monetary cost. | PHB p. 145‑146 |\n| **Warlock** | Warlocks normally use a **holy symbol** as their spellcasting focus.

{"user_input": "tell me how advantage works in d20 rolls and how i can use it in my story i want to know how advantage changes the roll what happens if i have both advantage and disadvantage how halfling lucky trait interacts and how gm can give advantage i want long explanation", "reference_contexts": ["Using Ability Scores Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics: • Strength, measuring physical power • Dexterity, measuring agility • Constitution, measuring endurance • Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory • Wisdom, measuring perception and insight • Charisma, measuring force of personalityIs a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number. Ability Scores and Modifiers Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability. A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30. Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30. Ability Scores and Modifiers Score Modifier 1 −5 2-3 −4 4-5 −3 6-7 −2 8-9 −1 10-11 +0 12 - 13 +1 14 - 15 +2 16 - 17 +3 18 - 19 +4 20 - 21 +5 22 - 23 +6 24 - 25 +7 26 - 27 +8 28 - 29 +9 30 +10 To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down). Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores. Advantage and Disadvantage Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20. If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage. When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1. You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result."], "response": "### 1. What “Advantage” Means in 5‑e D&D\n\n| Step | What the DM or PC does | What the player sees |\n|------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| 1 | **Roll two 20‑sided dice** (d20). | Two separate numbers appear on the table. |\n| 2 | **Choose the higher** of the two rolls. | The “better” number is kept. |\n| 3 | **Add all normal modifiers** (ability scores, proficiency, magic, etc.) to that number. | The final total is compared to the target number (DC, AC, etc.). |\n\nThe rule is *exact*: you always roll **exactly two d20** and take the higher.  You do **not** add the two numbers together; you simply discard the lower roll.  The modifiers are added after you have selected the higher roll, so they do not influence which d20 you keep.\n\n### 2. How Advantage Alters the Odds\n\nBecause you take the higher of two rolls, the probability of success increases, while the probability of failure decreases.  A single d20 roll has a 55 % chance to be at least 11, but with advantage it rises to roughly 64 % (the chance that **at least one** of the two dice is 11 or higher).  In general:\n\n- **Advantage** ≈ +5 to the expected value of the roll (the “average” result).  \n- **Disadvantage** ≈ –5 to the expected value.\n\nThese are rough numbers; the true odds depend on the exact DC you’re facing.\n\n### 3. Combining Advantage and Disadvantage\n\nIf you have **both** advantage *and* disadvantage on the same roll, they cancel out.  \nYou roll only **once** (a single d20) and apply the modifiers normally – *no* extra roll is made.  \n\n> **Why it cancels** – Advantage says “pick the best,” disadvantage says “pick the worst.”  The only way to satisfy both is to ignore the extra roll and treat the roll as normal.\n\nMultiple instances of advantage (or disadvantage) stack the same way: two advantages = one advantage; two disadvantages = one disadvantage.\n\n### 4. How “Halfling Lucky” Interacts\n\n**Halfling Lucky** (PHB, p. 27) reads:  \n\n> “If you roll a 1 or a 20 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll that d20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.”\n\n**Key points for interaction:**\n\n1. **When you have advantage**, you still roll two dice.  \n   - If **either** die is a 1 or 20, you can use Halfling Lucky on the *chosen* die (the one you kept).  \n   - If you choose the higher die and it is 20, you may reroll that 20.  \n   - If you choose the lower die (rare, if the higher is a 1 and you decide not to take advantage—though you’re *not* allowed to do that) and it’s a 1, you could reroll it, but you can’t pick the lower die when you have advantage.  \n\n2. **Order of operations**  \n   - First, roll for advantage/disadvantage.  \n   - Pick the appropriate die (higher or lower).  \n   - Check if it’s a 1 or 20.  \n   - If so, reroll that die once (you may reroll the same number or a different one).  \n   - After the reroll, add modifiers as usual.\n\n3. **You can still get advantage/disadvantage on the reroll**  \n   - The halfling lucky reroll is a single d20; if you’re still under disadvantage on that roll, you’d roll one die and take the lower (which is the same as a normal roll).  \n   - If you’re under advantage on the reroll (e.g., a “lucky” circumstance that gives advantage on the reroll), you would roll two dice again.  This is rare but possible with custom rules.\n\n### 5. How a GM Can Grant Advantage\n\nThe DM is the sole arbiter of advantage/disadvantage.  It can be granted in several ways:\n\n| Source | Typical Advantage/Disadvantage | How It Appears in the Narrative |\n|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Position** | Advantage on attack rolls | “You’re perched on a cliff overlooking the enemy.” |\n| **Cover** | Advantage on attack rolls | “You’re behind a boulder.” |\n| **Conditions** | Advantage on checks | “You’re not tired (no exhaustion).” |\n| **Spells** | Advantage on attack rolls or saves | “Bless is in effect.” |\n| **Class Features** | Advantage on certain checks | “Ranger’s Hunter’s Mark gives advantage.” |\n| **Magical Items** | Advantage on specific rolls | “A potion grants advantage on saving throws.” |\n| **Narrative** | Temporary advantage | “A friendly NPC gives you a boost.” |\n| **GM’s discretion** | Advantage/disadvantage for storytelling | “You’re caught off guard; disadvantage on your initiative.” |\n\n#### How the DM “applies” it\n\n- **Write it in the narration**: “You get advantage on the attack roll because you’re on higher ground.”\n- **Track it**: Many groups use a note or a token to remind themselves that advantage is active for the current roll.\n- **Ask for the roll**: When the player says “I want to roll,” the DM can say “You have advantage on this roll.” The player then rolls two d20, picks the higher, and adds modifiers.\n\n#### Example\n\n> **Scene**: A rogue is sneaking past a guard.  \n> **Narration**: “You’re crouched behind the stack of crates, giving you *advantage* on the Stealth check to avoid detection.”  \n> **Player**: “I’ll roll Stealth.”  \n> **DM**: “Roll two d20.”  \n> **Player**: “10 and 17. I’ll take 17.”  \n> **DM**: “Add your Dexterity modifier (+4) and Stealth proficiency (+2) to get 23. The guard’s Perception DC is 15, so you’re safe.”\n\n### 6. Using Advantage in Storytelling\n\nAdvantage is more than a number; it’s a way to emphasize narrative situations:\n\n1. **Emphasize positioning** – “Standing atop the tower, the hero gains advantage on the first arrow shot.”  \n2. **Highlight skillful play** – “The bard’s flawless timing gives them advantage on the Persuasion check.”  \n3. **Show environmental factors** – “The sudden rain makes the path slippery, giving disadvantage on the Acrobatics check to climb.”  \n4. **Introduce tension** – “While the party has advantage on the attack, the enemy’s spell grants them disadvantage on saving throws, turning the tide.”  \n5. **Reward cleverness** – “Using the halfling’s lucky trait, the party can reroll a disastrous 1 on a critical save.”\n\n### 7. Quick Reference Cheat‑Sheet\n\n| Situation | Advantage? | How to Roll |\n|-----------|------------|-------------|\n| High ground | ✔ | Roll 2 d20, take higher |\n| Cover | ✔ | Roll 2 d20, take higher |\n| Ranged weapon with Sneak Attack and an ally within 5 ft | ✔ | Roll 2 d20, take higher |\n| “Bless” spell active | ✔ | Roll 2 d20, take higher |\n| Disadvantage from a spell like “Hold Person” | ✔ | Roll 2 d20, take lower |\n| Both advantage & disadvantage | ❌ | Roll 1 d20 normally |\n| Halfling Lucky after advantage | ✔ | Roll 2 d20, pick higher → if 1/20, reroll that die once |\n\n### 8. Practical Example (Combining All)\n\n**Scenario**: A halfling rogue is attacking a goblin while standing on a ledge (advantage) but the goblin is using *Shillelagh* (disadvantage on saving throws, not on attack). The rogue also has a *Cunning Action* to disengage after the attack.\n\n- **Advantage** applies to the attack roll: roll 2 d20, pick higher.  \n- **No disadvantage** on the attack roll, so just add modifiers.  \n- After the attack, if the rogue rolls a 1 or 20, they can use Halfling Lucky to reroll that die.  \n- The goblin’s *Shillelagh* spell doesn’t affect the rogue’s attack; it would affect the goblin’s saving throw if the rogue’s attack had a special effect that requires a save.  \n- The rogue’s *Cunning Action* doesn’t influence the roll; it’s a separate action.\n\n**Narrative**:  \n> “Your foot slips slightly on the crumbling ledge, but you hold steady. With a swift twist of your wrist, the dagger arcing toward the goblin’s chest. Advantage from your elevated position gives you a higher chance to strike. The goblin’s *Shillelagh* spell, however, leaves it defenseless. You land a hit, and the goblin staggers.”\n\n---\n\n#### TL;DR\n\n- **Advantage**: Roll two d20, keep the higher, add modifiers.  \n- **Disadvantage**: Roll two d20, keep the lower.  \n- **Both**: Cancel – roll one d20 normally.  \n- **Halfling Lucky**: After selecting the die (with advantage/disadvantage), you may reroll if it’s a 1 or 20.  \n- **GM**: Grants advantage/disadvantage through environment, spells, conditions, or narrative.  \n\nUse advantage to make the story feel tense and dynamic—highlighting high ground, clever tactics, and luck—while keeping the math simple and transparent. Happy gaming!", "reference": "Advantage means you roll a second d20 and use the higher result. Disadvantage means you use the lower result. If you have both advantage and disadvantage you are considered to have neither and roll one d20.

Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once. By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0.

The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results. For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs. Typical Difficulty Classes Task Difficulty DC Very easy 5 Easy 10 Medium 15 Hard 20 Very hard 25 Nearly impossible 30 To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM. Contests Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal-for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest. Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding. If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut. Skills Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.) For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding. The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability. Strength •Athletics Dexterity •Acrobatics •Sleight of Hand •Stealth Intelligence •Arcana •History •Investigation •Nature •Religion Wisdom •Animal Handling •Insight •Medicine •Perception •Survival Charisma •Deception •Intimidation •Performance •PersuasionSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill-for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check. For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check. Variant: Skills with Different Abilities Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.", "<2-hop>\n\nUsing Ability Scores Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics: • Strength, measuring physical power • Dexterity, measuring agility • Constitution, measuring endurance • Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory • Wisdom, measuring perception and insight • Charisma, measuring force of personalityIs a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number. Ability Scores and Modifiers Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability. A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30. Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30. Ability Scores and Modifiers Score Modifier 1 −5 2-3 −4 4-5 −3 6-7 −2 8-9 −1 10-11 +0 12 - 13 +1 14 - 15 +2 16 - 17 +3 18 - 19 +4 20 - 21 +5 22 - 23 +6 24 - 25 +7 26 - 27 +8 28 - 29 +9 30 +10 To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down). Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores. Advantage and Disadvantage Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20. If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage. When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1. You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result."], "response": "### 1.  The Core of a Contest in 5e\n\n| Step | What happens | Why it matters |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **1. Identify the “Task”** | Pick the specific action the PC wants to do (e.g., *climb the broken wall*, *disarm the rune‑stone*, *defend against a claw swipe*). | Gives you the right ability or skill to use. |\n| **2. Pick the right check** | Either an *ability check* (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) or a *skill check* that’s based on an ability (e.g., Acrobatics = Dex). | The skill check automatically adds proficiency if the character is proficient. |\n| **3. Compute modifiers** | Add the relevant ability modifier and, if applicable, the proficiency bonus. | This is the “+” that turns a raw d20 into a meaningful number. |\n| **4. Apply Advantage/Disadvantage** | Roll two d20s, take the higher for advantage, lower for disadvantage. If both sides have advantage/disadvantage, the higher/lower of the two pairs is used. | This models the narrative advantage you’re giving the character or the monster. |\n| **5. Set or get the DC** | The DM sets a Difficulty Class (DC) for the task or the monster rolls a contested check. | The DC reflects how hard the task really is. |\n| **6. Roll & Resolve** | Roll the d20(s), add modifiers, compare to DC or the opponent’s roll. | The outcome (success, partial, failure) feeds into the story. |\n\n---\n\n### 2.  How the Numbers Are Calculated\n\n#### Ability Modifiers  \n- **Formula:** `(Ability Score – 10) ÷ 2`, rounded **down**.  \n- **Examples**  \n  *15 Strength → +2*  \n  *18 Dexterity → +4*  \n  *8 Wisdom → –1*\n\n#### Proficiency Bonus  \n- Determined by character level (Table 1.1 in *Player’s Handbook*).  \n  *Level 1–4 → +2, Level 5–8 → +3, etc.*\n\n#### Skill Modifier  \n- **Skill Modifier = Ability Modifier + Proficiency (if proficient)**  \n  *Example:* Dexterity 17 (+3) + Proficiency +3 → **+6** for Acrobatics.\n\n#### Total Check Modifier  \n- For a simple skill check: **Ability + Proficiency (if any)**  \n- For a *non‑skill* ability check (e.g., Strength to lift a boulder) you only add the ability modifier, not proficiency.  \n\n---\n\n### 3.  Advantage & Disadvantage in Detail\n\n| Situation | How to Roll | What you look at |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| **Advantage** | Roll 2 d20s, take the higher | The higher roll becomes your d20 result |\n| **Disadvantage** | Roll 2 d20s, take the lower | The lower roll becomes your d20 result |\n| **Both Advantage** | Roll 4 d20s, take the two highest | Equivalent to a single advantage |\n| **Both Disadvantage** | Roll 4 d20s, take the two lowest | Equivalent to a single disadvantage |\n| **Advantage + Disadvantage** | They cancel → normal single roll |\n\n*If a PC has advantage while the monster has disadvantage, the DM must decide how the two interact. A common choice is to let each side roll their own advantage/disadvantage and compare the results.*\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Contested Checks\n\nA *contest* is essentially two checks opposed to each other. The DM can:\n\n1. **Set a DC** equal to the monster’s stat or a narrative factor (e.g., a 16 DC for a *tightrope crossing*).\n2. **Let the monster roll** its own check (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) and compare the *raw results* (without modifiers) to the PC’s result.  \n   *Example:* PC rolls Strength (mod +3) with advantage → **19**.  \n   Monster rolls Strength → **14**.  \n   The PC wins the contest.\n\n> **Rule‑wise**: The DM decides whether the monster gets a modifier or a flat DC. The *Dungeon Master’s Guide* suggests using a flat DC for consistency unless a monster’s special feature calls for a contested check.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Putting It All Together: A Vivid, Rule‑Based Scene\n\n> **Scenario**: The party must climb a slick, abandoned tower to retrieve a cursed gem before the **Basilisk** that lurks in the shadows can strike. The tower’s ledges are narrow, and the basilisk’s eye glare turns any living thing to stone.\n\n| Step | What the DM says | What the PC does | Numbers |\n|------|------------------|------------------|---------|\n| 1. **Task** | “You must make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to balance your way up the tower.” | Uses Acrobatics. |  |\n| 2. **Modifiers** | Player has Dex 18 (+4) and is proficient in Acrobatics (+3). | Total modifier: +7 |  |\n| 3. **Advantage** | “You’re in the basilisk’s blind spot—advantage.” | Advantage on the check. |  |\n| 4. **Roll** | 2d20 → 12 / 16 → take 16 | +7 → **23** |  |\n| 5. **DC** | “The tower’s ledges are slick—DC 20.” |  |\n| 6. **Outcome** | 23 ≥ 20 → **Success**. | Player slides up without slipping. |  |\n| 7. **Narrative Flair** | “The wind howls as you reach the next ledge, but your practiced balance keeps you aloft. The basilisk’s gaze lags, its eyes already turning to stone.” |  |  |\n\nIf the basilisk had **disadvantage** (maybe due to its own confusion from a *Mirror Image* spell), the DM could let the basilisk roll a Strength check with disadvantage and compare the raw totals. The player’s 23 would beat any 22 or lower.\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Tweaking for Lore & Flavor\n\n1. **Tie the DC to lore** – *A DC of 22 might be “the threshold of the tower’s ancient ward, which only a seasoned scholar knows how to bypass.”*  \n2. **Use special monster traits** – *A Basilisk’s “Petrifying Gaze” can give it advantage on a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the party.*  \n3. **Add environmental modifiers** – *Wind, rain, or a magical aura can impose a –2 penalty or grant advantage.*  \n4. **Narrate partial successes** – *A “Half‑DC” rule: if the check is within 5 of the DC, you succeed but suffer a penalty (e.g., take 1d4 psychic damage from the basilisk’s gaze).*\n\n---\n\n### 7.  Quick Reference Cheat Sheet\n\n| Element | Formula | Example |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| Ability Mod | `(Score – 10) ÷ 2` | 16 → +3 |\n| Proficiency | Table 1.1 | Level 7 → +3 |\n| Skill Mod | Ability + Proficiency (if prof.) | Dex 18 (+4) + Proficiency +3 = +7 |\n| Advantage | Roll 2d20, take higher | 12/17 → 17 |\n| Disadvantage | Roll 2d20, take lower | 12/17 → 12 |\n| Total Check | d20 + Skill Mod | 17 + 7 = **24** |\n| DC | DM‑set or monster’s stat | DC 20 |\n| Contest | Compare raw totals or check vs. DC | 24 vs 20 → Success |\n\n---\n\n### 8.  Bottom Line\n\n1. **Pick the right check** (skill or ability).  \n2. **Add the correct modifiers** (ability + proficiency if applicable).  \n3. **Apply advantage/disadvantage** by rolling appropriately.  \n4. **Compare to a DC** (set by DM) or to an opponent’s raw check.  \n5. **Narrate the outcome** in a way that reflects the character’s skill, the monster’s prowess, and the world’s lore.\n\nWith this framework you can turn any mundane task into a *dramatic, rules‑compliant showdown* that feels as rich in story as it is in mechanical depth. Happy gaming!", "reference": "To run a flavorful contest with the d20 system, start by deciding which ability is relevant to the task. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster tries an action that can fail. The player rolls a d20 and adds the relevant ability modifier. If the total meets or exceeds the DC, the check succeeds; otherwise it fails. In a contest, two participants each roll a d20 and add the same type of modifier. The higher total wins the contest; a tie means no change. Skills are tied to abilities; for example, a Dexterity check can use Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth. If a character is proficient in a skill, the proficiency bonus is added to the check. The proficiency bonus is the same for all skills a character is proficient in. Ability scores range from 1 to 30. The modifier for a score is calculated by subtracting 10 and dividing by 2, rounding down. For example, a score of 18 gives a +4 modifier. The modifier is added to the d20 roll for all checks, saves, and attacks. Advantage or disadvantage changes the roll: roll two d20s and take the higher if you have advantage, or the lower if you have disadvantage. If you have both, you roll only one d20.

The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results. For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs. Typical Difficulty Classes Task Difficulty DC Very easy 5 Easy 10 Medium 15 Hard 20 Very hard 25 Nearly impossible 30 To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM. Contests Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal-for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest. Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding. If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut. Skills Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.) For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding. The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability. Strength •Athletics Dexterity •Acrobatics •Sleight of Hand •Stealth Intelligence •Arcana •History •Investigation •Nature •Religion Wisdom •Animal Handling •Insight •Medicine •Perception •Survival Charisma •Deception •Intimidation •Performance •PersuasionSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill-for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check. For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check. Variant: Skills with Different Abilities Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.", "<2-hop>\n\nProficiency Bonus Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save. Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once. By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks. In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply."], "response": "### 1.  How a Wisdom (Perception) check is made  \n\n| Step | What you do | Why |\n|------|-------------|-----|\n| **1. Roll** | Roll a d20. | The dice is the core of the check. |\n| **2. Add the Wisdom modifier** | + WIS modifier (e.g., +3). | Every Wisdom‑based check uses the WIS mod. |\n| **3. Add the skill bonus (if you’re proficient)** | + proficiency bonus (if you’re *proficient* in Perception). | Only the proficiency for that particular skill counts. |\n| **4. Add expertise (if you have it)** | + *another* proficiency bonus (i.e., double the proficiency for that skill). | Expertise **doubles** the skill bonus, it does **not** add proficiency twice. |\n| **5. Total = d20 + WIS mod + (skill bonus).** | This is compared to the DC. | |\n\n**Example**\n\n*Your character is a 5th‑level ranger, WIS +4, proficient in Perception, and has Expertise in Perception.*\n\n| Bonus | Amount | Reason |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| WIS mod | +4 | base |\n| Proficiency | +4 | level 5 → +4 |\n| Expertise | +4 | doubles proficiency, not added again |\n\n**Total** = d20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = d20 + 12.\n\n### 2.  “Don’t add proficiency twice” rule\n\n- **PHB p. 170** – “If you’re proficient, add your proficiency bonus to the check.”  \n- **PHB p. 177** – “When you have expertise, double your proficiency bonus for that skill.”  \n- **Interpretation** – You add *one* proficiency bonus, then double it if you have expertise. You never add the bonus two separate times (e.g., you never do +4 + +4 + +4 for a level‑5 ranger with expertise).\n\n### 3.  Proficiency in *other* skills\n\nYou can’t use proficiency from, say, Insight or Investigation to boost a Perception check.  \nEach skill is a separate “area of proficiency.”  \nIf you’re not proficient in Perception, the only bonus you get is the WIS modifier.\n\n### 4.  Monsters vs. Characters\n\n| Who | Skill bonus | Passive Perception |\n|-----|-------------|--------------------|\n| **Characters** | Proficiency bonus if *proficient* in Perception. | Same as above (10 + WIS mod + proficiency if proficient). |\n| **Monsters** | Stat block lists a *skill bonus* next to “Perception” if the monster is proficient. | “Passive Perception” is always 10 + WIS mod + skill bonus (if any). |\n\n- If a monster is *not* proficient in Perception, it just has 10 + WIS mod.\n\n### 5.  Typical DCs for tasks\n\nThe DMG (and PHB) gives a quick‑reference table. (Numbers are illustrative; the DM may adjust.)\n\n| Difficulty | Approx. DC |\n|------------|------------|\n| Very easy | 5–10 |\n| Easy | 11–15 |\n| Medium | 16–20 |\n| Hard | 21–25 |\n| Very hard | 26+ |\n\n*Perception* tasks usually land in the **Medium** range (DC 15–20) for a normal hidden object or a creature hiding in cover.  DMG p. 164 suggests:\n\n- Spotting a hidden door: DC 15.  \n- Detecting a creature in dim light: DC 12.  \n- Hearing a faint whisper from 30 ft: DC 13.\n\nFeel free to adjust based on how “obvious” or “elusive” the task is.\n\n### 6.  Ability Check vs. Contest\n\n| Situation | What it is | How it’s resolved |\n|-----------|------------|-------------------|\n| **You’re alone** (e.g., you’re looking for a hidden door) | **Ability check** | Roll d20 + modifiers, compare to DC. |\n| **Two entities oppose each other** (e.g., you try to hide, the monster tries to spot you) | **Contest** | Both sides roll the same check (e.g., Wisdom (Perception)). The higher result wins. Tie goes to the *contestant* that started the contest. |\n\n- **Wisdom check** can be a *contest* if the monster is actively looking for you.  \n- If the monster has a *passive Perception* (10 + its modifiers), you compare your check to that number. No contest rolls are made.\n\n### 7.  Quick cheat‑sheet\n\n| Check | What you add | Expertise | Example (5th‑level ranger, WIS +4, proficient & expert in Perception) |\n|-------|--------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Ability check** | d20 + WIS + proficiency (if prof) | Doubles proficiency | d20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = d20 + 12 |\n| **Contest** | Same as ability check, but you roll vs. opponent | Same | d20 + 12 vs. opponent’s roll |\n| **Passive Perception** | 10 + WIS + proficiency (if prof) | N/A | 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- Add your Wisdom modifier.  \n- Add your *own* proficiency bonus if you’re proficient in Perception.  \n- If you have expertise, double that proficiency bonus (don’t add it twice).  \n- Proficiency from other skills doesn’t help.  \n- Monsters use the same rules—just look at their stat block for Perception bonuses.  \n- Use the DC table for guidance, and remember that contests happen when someone else is actively trying to out‑check you.", "reference": "To make a Wisdom (Perception) check you roll a d20, add your Wisdom modifier, and add your proficiency bonus if you are proficient in the Perception skill.

If you have the Expertise feature, you double the proficiency bonus for that check, but you still add it only once.  The DC for the task comes from the Typical Difficulty Classes table: Very easy 5, Easy 10, Medium 15, Hard 20, Very hard 25, Nearly impossible 30.  Monsters also have a proficiency bonus that is used in the same way for their ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.  When a contest occurs, each participant makes an ability check (for example, a Wisdom (Perception) check vs a Wisdom (Insight) check) and the higher total wins; ties leave the situation unchanged.

Damage = 1d8 + Dex (or Str) piercing. |\n| **20 arrows** | Ammunition for the longbow. | 1 arrow per attack roll. You have 20 rounds of fire before you run out. |\n\n> **Starting AC** (with no shield)  \n>  - Dex + 2 → AC = 13  \n>  - Dex + 4 → AC = 15  \n\n> **Attack bonus** (at 1st level, proficiency +2)  \n>  - Dex +2 → +4 attack, +2 damage  \n>  - Dex +4 → +6 attack, +4 damage  \n\n> **Range**  \n>  - 150 ft (normal), 300 ft (maximum).  \n>  - “Two-handed” – you can’t use it with a shield.\n\n**How good is a longbow for a Fighter?**\n\n| Consideration | Impact |\n|---------------|--------|\n| **Strength vs. Dexterity** | Fighters usually train with Strength for melee, so a Dex‑based longbow might feel “out of place.” If your character has a decent Dex (e.g., 14 + +1 from a race), the longbow is a solid ranged option. |\n| **Extra Attack** | From 5th level onward, you can attack twice with a single action. That means you could potentially fire two arrows per round, effectively doubling your damage output versus a single‑shot weapon. |\n| **Range** | The longbow’s 150‑ft range lets you stay out of melee range of most foes, a big plus if your fighter is meant to “shoot‑and‑scoot.” |\n| **Ammo Load** | 20 arrows is a decent supply for early levels (you can fire 5 arrows per round with Extra Attack, so you’re good for 4 rounds before you need to resupply). |\n| **Versatility** | You can swap the longbow for a shortbow, hand crossbow, or even a ranged weapon from a different subclass (e.g., a Warlock’s Eldritch Blast) if you want more flexibility. |\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Good choice** if you plan to keep distance, have a respectable Dex, and want to leverage the Fighter’s Extra Attack to hit twice with a longbow.\n- **Less ideal** for a typical Strength‑focused Fighter who prefers melee, or if you’re stuck with a low Dex (you’ll miss more and do less damage).\n- **Practical tip**: Keep a spare set of arrows or a hand crossbow for short‑range situations, and consider a shield or a heavier armor (chain shirt, breastplate) once you’re out of the early levels.\n\nSo, leather armor + longbow + 20 arrows gives you a light‑weight, long‑range combatant that can dish out decent damage from afar, especially if your character leans toward Dexterity.", "reference": "You get leather armor, a longbow, and 20 arrows.

Perfect Self Unarmored Defense Beginning at1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. Martial Arts At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield: •You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strike sand monk weapons. •You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage ofyour unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. •When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon. Ki Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: KisaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Flurry of Blows Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. Patient Defense You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Step of the Wind You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. Unarmored Movement Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. Monastic Tradition When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Deflect Missiles Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.

Unarmored defense gives an AC of 10 plus your Dexterity modifier plus your Wisdom modifier. Martial arts lets you use Dexterity instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls of unarmed strikes and monk weapons, and you roll a d4 for damage instead of the normal damage of the weapon. The damage die changes as you level: d4 at levels 1‑4, d6 at levels 5‑10, d8 at levels 11‑16, and d10 at levels 17‑20.

Perfect Self Unarmored Defense Beginning at1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. Martial Arts At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield: •You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strike sand monk weapons. •You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage ofyour unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. •When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon. Ki Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: KisaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Flurry of Blows Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. Patient Defense You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Step of the Wind You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. Unarmored Movement Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. Monastic Tradition When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Deflect Missiles Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.

Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Second Wind You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Action Surge Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn. Martial Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques, such as Champion. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class. Indomitable Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level. Martial Archetypes Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach. Champion The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows. Improved Critical Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Remarkable Athlete Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use your proficiency bonus. In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier. Additional Fighting Style At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature. Superior Critical Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20. Survivor At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points. Monk Class Features As a monk, you gain the following class features.

Can’t wear armor (otherwise martial arts are lost). | Proficient with all armor. Can choose light, medium, or heavy for higher AC and armor‑based features. |\n| **Weapon Proficiency** | Simple weapons + monk weapons (shortsword, shortspear, kama, etc.). | All weapons, giving far more options for damage types and special effects (e.g., great weapons, two‑weapon fighting). |\n| **Attack Bonus** | Dex (or Str if using a monk weapon) for attack rolls. | Str or Dex, depending on the weapon. |\n| **Base Damage** | Martial Arts: 1 + Dex (or Str) for unarmed/martial attacks; +1 extra damage to each hit. | Regular weapon damage + Strength (or Dex). Fighting styles can add +1 or +2 to damage or AC. |\n| **Extra Attack** | At 5th & 11th levels. | At 5th, 11th, and 17th levels. |\n| **Bonus‑Action Attack** | *Flurry of Blows*: 2 unarmed strikes for 2 ki points. | Two‑Weapon Fighting: 1 off‑hand attack for 1 bonus action (only if you’re two‑weapon fighting). |\n| **Ki Features** | 4–6 ki points (increases each level). Spend ki on:  \n  • Flurry of Blows (extra attacks)  \n  • Patient Defense (extra AC)  \n  • Step of the Wind (extra movement & dash)  \n  • Stunning Strike (control)  \n  • Ki‑based defensive/offensive bonuses | No ki. Features:  \n  • Action Surge (extra action once per rest)  \n  • Second Wind (self‑heal)  \n  • Indomitable (reroll a failed saving throw) |\n| **Action Economy** | 1 Action + 1 Bonus Action per round (plus reactions). Flurry/Patient Defense use bonus action. | 1 Action + 1 Bonus Action per round (can use two‑weapon off‑hand). Action Surge gives an extra Action once per rest. |\n| **Mobility** | Step of the Wind gives extra movement and dash; unarmored movement bonus from Dexterity. | Can use Dash, Disengage, etc., but no ki‑based movement unless they pick “Mobile” feat. |\n| **Survivability** | Unarmored AC can be very high (Dex + Wis + 10). Ki can add extra AC or heal (Stunning Strike doesn’t heal). | Heavy armor + proficiency gives high AC; Action Surge and Second Wind give extra staying power. |\n| **Combat Style** | “Hit‑and‑run”: many quick attacks, high mobility, can stagger or control enemies with ki. | “Sustained damage”: heavier weapons, extra attack, can absorb damage in heavy armor. |\n\n---\n\n### Practical impact on melee combat\n\n| Monk | Fighter |\n|------|---------|\n| **Damage output** – Multiple small hits per round. Two extra attacks (Flurry) can keep the damage flow high, especially at levels 10–20 when the monk’s Ki points are abundant. The +1 damage per hit adds up. | **Damage output** – Fewer but often larger blows. Great Weapon Fighting can boost the damage of each hit. Extra attacks from 5th, 11th, and 17th levels increase total damage, but you’re limited to one attack per round unless you use Two‑Weapon Fighting. |\n| **Consistency** – Attack rolls use Dex (often higher than Strength). AC is also Dex‑based, so a high‑Dex build can keep both attack rolls and AC high. | **Versatility** – Can choose weapons that fit the situation (great weapons for huge damage, finesse weapons for Dex). Fighting styles add a small but useful bonus to either damage or AC. |\n| **Mobility & control** – Step of the Wind and Stunning Strike give the monk the ability to move, evade, or stun, letting them “pick off” weaker enemies or escape dangerous situations. | **Durability** – Heavy armor + Action Surge + Second Wind let the fighter stay in the fight longer, absorbing damage and dealing it back. |\n| **Resource management** – Ki points must be spent; running out of Ki can leave the monk defenseless in a hard fight. The monk must balance ki usage between extra attacks and defensive options. | **Single‑point bursts** – Action Surge is a powerful but one‑use‑per‑rest burst of damage or mobility. Fighters can plan to use it in the right moment. |\n| **Synergy with other classes** – A monk with the “Fighting Style: Defense” or “Dueling” feat can get +1 AC or +2 damage, but the core of monk power is ki, not feats. | **Feat-friendly** – Fighters benefit from many feats (Great Weapon Master, Sharpshooter, Mobile, Dual Wielder, etc.) that can tweak their combat style. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n* **Monks** excel at *speed, versatility, and control*. Their unarmored defense and ki‑based abilities let them fight effectively without armor, keep up multiple attacks, and use ki to dodge or stagger foes. They’re best when you want to keep moving, hit hard multiple times, and manage a limited resource (ki) for tactical options.\n\n* **Fighters** are *durable, high‑damage, and simple*. Their armor proficiency gives them high AC, and their fighting style plus Action Surge lets them output big damage bursts and survive tough encounters. They shine when you want raw damage, sustained fights, and straightforward use of armor.\n\nChoosing between them comes down to the style you want: a nimble, ki‑driven melee specialist (Monk) vs. a hardened, high‑damage combatant who can soak and deal damage in heavy armor (Fighter).", "reference": "A Monk and a Fighter approach melee combat from very different design philosophies, and the information in the two context segments shows how their core features shape that difference.\n\n**Hit Points and Proficiency**\n- A Monk starts with 8 + Constitution modifier hit points at 1st level and gains 1d8 (or 5) + Constitution modifier per level thereafter.  The Monk’s proficiency bonus follows the standard table, starting at +2 and increasing with level.\n- A Fighter also begins with 10 + Constitution modifier hit points and gains 1d10 + Constitution modifier per level.  The Fighter’s proficiency bonus is identical to the Monk’s, starting at +2.\n\n**Armor and AC**\n- The Monk’s class features explicitly state that the character wears no armor and does not wield a shield.  The Monk’s Armor Class is calculated as 10 + Dexterity modifier + Wisdom modifier (Unarmored Defense).  This means a Monk relies on Dexterity and Wisdom to keep AC high.\n- The Fighter, by contrast, is proficient with all armor and shields.  The Fighter can choose to wear chain mail, leather armor, or any other armor type, and can also use a shield.  The Fighter’s AC is therefore 10 + Dexterity modifier + armor bonus (or 10 + Dexterity modifier + shield bonus if a shield is used).  The Fighter also has the Defense fighting style, which adds +1 to AC when wearing armor.\n\n**Weapon Proficiency and Combat Style**\n- The Monk is limited to simple weapons and shortswords (monk weapons).  The Monk can use Dexterity instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes and monk weapons, and can roll a d4 (increasing with level) for the damage of those attacks.  The Monk also gains a bonus action unarmed strike when using the Attack action.\n- The Fighter is proficient with simple and martial weapons, and can choose a martial weapon and a shield or two martial weapons.  The Fighter can also use a light crossbow or handaxes.  The Fighter’s combat style options (e.g., Dueling, Two‑Weapon Fighting, Great Weapon Fighting) modify attack or damage rolls, and the Fighter can use a shield for a defensive bonus.\n\n**Movement and Mobility**\n- The Monk gains Unarmored Movement, a 10‑foot speed increase at 2nd level that grows with level.  At 9th level the Monk can move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling.\n- The Fighter does not receive a special movement bonus, but can use the Step of the Wind ki feature (Monk) or the Action Surge (Fighter) to increase movement or take extra actions.\n\n**Ki vs. Action Economy**\n- The Monk’s ki system provides a pool of points that can be spent on Flurry of Blows (two unarmed strikes as a bonus action), Patient Defense (Dodge as a bonus action), Step of the Wind (Dash or Disengage as a bonus action), and other ki features that scale with level.  Ki points are regained after a short or long rest.\n- The Fighter’s action economy is enhanced by features such as Extra Attack (starting at 5th level, increasing to four attacks at 20th level), Action Surge (one extra action per short or long rest, two at 17th level), and Second Wind (bonus action to regain hit points).  The Fighter also gains Indomitable to reroll failed saves.\n\n**Overall Effectiveness in Melee**\n- A Monk excels in speed, mobility, and the ability to strike multiple times with unarmed or monk weapons, especially when using ki to add bonus actions or to increase movement.  The Monk’s AC relies on Dexterity and Wisdom, so a high Wisdom score is crucial for survivability.\n- A Fighter relies on armor for protection, multiple attacks per action, and the ability to use a shield for defensive bonuses.  The Fighter’s action surge and extra attacks give a high damage output, while Second Wind provides a small self‑heal.\n- In a direct melee encounter, a Monk can outmaneuver a Fighter with superior speed and unarmored defense, but a Fighter can out‑damage a Monk with multiple attacks and armor protection.  The choice between the two classes depends on whether the player prefers a fast, agile, ki‑based combat style (Monk) or a heavily armored, high‑damage, action‑economy‑focused style (Fighter).", "answer_relevancy": 0.7700971872439392, "semantic_similarity": 0.6560936669390997, "bleu_score": 0.08477112911296592, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.17804551539491298, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.1658354114713217, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.19219653179190752}

Perfect Self Unarmored Defense Beginning at1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. Martial Arts At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield: •You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strike sand monk weapons. •You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage ofyour unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. •When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon. Ki Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: KisaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Flurry of Blows Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. Patient Defense You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Step of the Wind You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. Unarmored Movement Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. Monastic Tradition When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Deflect Missiles Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.

Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Second Wind You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Action Surge Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn. Martial Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques, such as Champion. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class. Indomitable Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level. Martial Archetypes Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach. Champion The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows. Improved Critical Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Remarkable Athlete Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use your proficiency bonus. In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier. Additional Fighting Style At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature. Superior Critical Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20. Survivor At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points. Monk Class Features As a monk, you gain the following class features.

They affect different aspects of a character and can’t be directly compared in a “better vs. worse” sense.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What each feature does\n\n| Feature | What it gives you | When it applies | How it works |\n|---------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| **Monk – Unarmored Movement** | Bonus to your base speed | *Only when you are not wearing armor or a shield* | +10% at 2nd lvl, +15% at 6th, +20% at 10th, +25% at 14th, +30% at 18th. Adds to the entire speed value (e.g., a 30 ft. speed becomes 36 ft. at 2nd lvl, 42 ft. at 6th lvl, etc.). |\n| **Fighter – Armor Proficiency** | Ability to wear certain armor without penalty and to add your proficiency bonus to that armor’s AC | Whenever you wear armor you’re proficient with | You add +1 proficiency bonus (2 at 1st, 3 at 5th, 4 at 9th, 5 at 13th, 6 at 17th) to the armor’s listed AC. If the armor is medium/ heavy, you can also add the proficiency bonus to the armor’s AC, and you can wear it without a penalty.*\n\n### Key differences\n\n| Aspect | Monk | Fighter |\n|--------|------|---------|\n| **Primary stat** | Dexterity (speed) | Dexterity or Strength (AC) |\n| **When used** | Only in an *unarmored* state | While wearing armor you’re proficient in |\n| **What it improves** | How fast you can move (and also grants “unarmored defense” for AC) | How much damage you can take before being hit (AC) |\n| **Interaction** | Wearing armor removes the movement bonus; you can still use the monk’s “Unarmored Defense” AC bonus if you’re wearing light armor, but you lose the speed benefit. | If you want to use the monk’s speed bonus, you must forgo armor (or at best wear only *light* armor that doesn’t grant proficiency bonus). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Practical implications\n\n### Speed comparison\n\n| Level | Monk speed bonus | Example speed with 30 ft base |\n|-------|------------------|------------------------------|\n| 2nd | +10% | 33 ft. |\n| 6th | +15% | 34.5 ft. |\n| 10th | +20% | 36 ft. |\n| 14th | +25% | 37.5 ft. |\n| 18th | +30% | 39 ft. |\n\n*Fighter has no inherent speed bonus at these levels unless you grant a separate feature (e.g., Boots of Speed, a spell, or a feat).*\n\n### AC comparison\n\n| Level | Fighter proficiency bonus | Example AC with chain mail (18 ft. base) |\n|-------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| 1st | +2 | 20 |\n| 5th | +3 | 21 |\n| 9th | +4 | 22 |\n| 13th | +5 | 23 |\n| 17th | +6 | 24 |\n\n*A monk, if he chooses to wear light armor, can use the monk’s “Unarmored Defense” (DEX + 10) which at 10th lvl might be 20, and add the light armor’s AC (11) for a total of 31—far above the fighter’s AC, but only while not moving at high speed.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Decision‑making: monk vs. fighter\n\n| Situation | Monk is usually better | Fighter is usually better |\n|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| You need a lot of movement (e.g., a scout, battlefield control) | ✔ | ✖ |\n| You want to be a frontline tank with high AC | ✔ (via Unarmored Defense or heavy armor, but sacrifice speed) | ✔ |\n| You want to use medium/ heavy armor to reduce damage | ✖ (no proficiency) | ✔ |\n| You want a single, simple build that excels at one thing (speed or tanking) | ✔ (speed) | ✔ (tanking) |\n| You want a character that can do both (speed & decent AC) | Partial: a monk can wear light armor and still get speed; still far from a fighter’s AC with medium armor | Partial: a fighter can use a spell or a feat to increase speed, but still can’t match monk’s speed bonus |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bottom line\n\n- **Monk’s Unarmored Movement** is a *speed bonus* that disappears if you wear armor or a shield.  \n- **Fighter’s Armor Proficiency** is a *proficiency bonus to AC* (and ability to wear certain armor without penalty).  \n\nThey address entirely different tactical needs. Pick the class that matches the role you want to play: speed‑centric monks or tank‑centric fighters.

{"user_input": "Attunement in D&D 5e: What are the lore and flavor implications for a narrativeist looking to weave attunement into a campaign, including how prerequisites, short rest focus, and attunement limits can be used creatively to enhance storytelling and character development?", "reference_contexts": ["Magic Items Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s capabilities in wondrous ways. Attunement Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that class’s spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties. Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words. An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more than one ring of protection at a time. A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed. Wearing and Wielding Items Using a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held. In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn’t adjust. For example, drow-made armor might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped folk. When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t wear boots. Multiple Items of the Same Kind Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can’t normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks. Paired Items Items that come in pairs-such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either."], "response": "**Attunement as a Narrative Hook**\n\nIn 5e a magic item “needs to be attuned” because the spell that makes it work must be *woven* into the bearer’s very essence.  For a story‑teller that’s a ready‑made way to talk about *connection*, *commitment*, and *cost*.  Below are the key flavor threads and how they can be stretched into plot points, character arcs, and world‑building.\n\n| Element | Lore / Flavor Implications | Creative Story‑telling Uses |\n|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Prerequisites** |  • Level, class, alignment, or skill reflect a character’s “readiness” to hold a certain power.  • They suggest that the item is attuned to a particular **type of bearer** (e.g., a paladin’s sword can only bind to a holy soul).  |  • Quest for the prerequisite – a character must gain a new level, learn a skill, or perform a rite before the item can bind.  <br>• Alignment‑based limits force characters to face moral choices (e.g., a good‑aligned warlock losing a pact if they turn evil).  <br>• Cultural prerequisites (e.g., “you must be a dragon‑kin” or “you must be able to speak the ancient tongue”) can introduce guilds, rites, or hidden lore that the party must discover. |\n| **Short‑Rest Requirement** |  Attunement takes a *short rest*: a ritual of focus, meditation, or a protective ritual.  It implies that the bearer must be in a *safe, quiet place* to channel the magic. |  • The party must secure a safe spot before a siege or chase; the DM can make the short rest a plot point (e.g., a hidden cave, a druid’s glade, a tavern that keeps the night).  <br>• Interruptions can lead to partial attunement, cursed items, or a race‑against‑time scene (the party is ambushed while “attuning”).  <br>• You can replace the rule with a custom “ritual” that requires certain ingredients or a specific location, adding a scavenger‑hunt element. |\n| **Attunement Limit (3 items)** |  Only three items can be bound at once—magic is *personal* and *finite*.  It forces characters to *choose* which powers matter most. |  • Sacrificial choice: a character must drop an old item to gain a new one, sparking role‑play about loss.  <br>• Conflict: an ally wants a powerful amulet but already has three, so the party must negotiate or temporarily dis‑attune.  <br>• Narrative tension: the party enters a dungeon with four desirable items; they must decide which to keep and which to leave behind.  <br>• Plot device: a cursed item can only stay attuned for a limited time; once the limit is hit, the item may “break” or require a hero’s sacrifice. |\n\n---\n\n### Weaving Attunement into Campaign Beats\n\n1. **Binding Rites & Lore**\n   *Create a culture of attunement.*  \n   *Example:* In a mountain kingdom, the “Council of the Blade” holds a midnight ceremony where a warrior must swear an oath before the Sunblade can bind.  The oath itself becomes a story hook—perhaps the warrior must decide whether to keep a promise or follow a new path.\n\n2. **Prerequisite Quests**\n   *Turn a simple rule into a full‑blown side‑quest.*  \n   *Example:* The Staff of Frost requires the bearer to “understand the language of the cold.”  The party must find an ancient scroll or an elderly sage who teaches the language in exchange for a favor, revealing lore about the item’s origin.\n\n3. **Short‑Rest Drama**\n   *Use the short rest as a “camp scene.”*  \n   *Example:* The party is ambushed by goblins while attempting to attune a powerful amulet.  They must decide: fight, flee, or try to finish the ritual under fire.  Success or failure can alter the amulet’s powers.\n\n4. **Attunement Limits as Moral Choices**\n   *Let the cap force character growth.*  \n   *Example:* A necromancer has two cursed items and a newly found **Heart of the Dead**.  If they keep all three, the Heart will slowly consume them.  The character must weigh the power against the cost—an excellent moment for character‑arc introspection.\n\n5. **Attunement as Narrative Theme**\n   *Repeat the binding process across the campaign.*  \n   *Example:* Each major milestone (saving a town, defeating an evil archmage, etc.) is sealed by attuning a different item.  The item’s nature mirrors the story theme: a “Shield of Unity” for a coalition, a “Blade of Reckoning” for a personal vendetta, etc.\n\n6. **World‑Building Through Attunement**\n   *Embed attunement rituals into the geography.*  \n   *Example:* The “Lake of Binding” is the only place where a certain artifact can be attuned.  The party must travel, protect the lake from poachers, and perform the ritual, adding environmental storytelling.\n\n---\n\n### Character Development Angles\n\n| Angle | Example |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Alignment & Growth** | A paladin’s holy sword refuses to attune until they pass a test of faith.  Failure forces them to confront doubt. |\n| **Skill & Mastery** | A rogue cannot attune a pair of daggers that require proficiency in “Stealth.”  They must train, possibly under a master thief. |\n| **Sacrifice & Loss** | An adventurer gives up a family heirloom to attune a new relic that saves the town. |\n| **Cultural Identity** | A druid from the Forest of Whispering Winds cannot attune a non‑natural item unless they leave the forest—a test of belonging. |\n| **Psychological Bond** | An item has a sentient spirit that “speaks” during attunement.  The spirit reveals the bearer’s hidden trauma or desires, opening a role‑play avenue. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips for DMs\n\n1. **Narrative Flexibility** – Treat the rules as *starting points*; you can modify prerequisites, allow attunement in other ways, or raise the short‑rest bar to suit your story.\n2. **Use Attunement as a Hook** – Even if a character already has a powerful item, a new quest can revolve around “attuning” a relic that will give them a narrative advantage.\n3. **Reward Choice** – Let the act of attuning feel consequential; the item’s description should mention a *bond* or *promise* the character now shares.\n4. **Keep the Limits in Play** – The three‑item cap should feel like a *constraint* that encourages teamwork and debate rather than a hand‑cuff.\n\nBy treating attunement as *a story device*—a ritual, a pact, a cost—you can enrich your world, give characters tangible goals, and weave magic directly into the fabric of the plot.", "reference": "Attunement is a bond that a creature must form with a magic item before its magical properties can be used.

A magic item’s description gives the item’s name, its category, its rarity, and its magical properties. Adamantine Armor Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you’re wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3 Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical. Amulet of Health Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is already 19 or higher. Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing this amulet, you are hidden from divination magic. You can’t be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. Amulet of the Planes Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shiftspell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence. Animated Shield Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement) While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free. Apparatus of the Crab Wondrous item, legendary This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics: Armor Class: 20 Hit Points: 200 Speed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren’t extended) Damage Immunities: poison, psychic To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure. A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table. Apparatus of the Crab Levers Lever Up Down 1 Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim. Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus’s speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed. 2 Forward window shutter opens. Forward window shutter closes. 3 Side window shutters open (two per side). Side window shutters close (two per side). 4 Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus. The claws retract. 5 Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6 ) bludgeoning damage. Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 15). 6 The apparatus walks or swims forward.

Armor of Invulnerability Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement) You have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor.

You and up to six willing creatures within 10 ft. teleport to that plane.  If you are already on the chosen plane, you return to the plane you were on before activating the amulet. |\n| **Limitations** | • Can be used **once per day**.  <br>• The amulet **cannot** transport you to a plane you have never been on.  <br>• If the current plane forbids planar travel (e.g., a sealed prison, a plane with strict magic barriers), the amulet cannot be used. |\n\n### How it Works in Practice\n1. **Preparation** – Keep a list (or memory) of planes you’ve visited; the amulet only works to those.  \n2. **Activation** – On your turn, use an action to activate it.  \n3. **Choice** – Pick the destination plane.  \n4. **Teleportation** – You and up to six willing allies within 10 ft. instantly appear on that plane.  \n5. **Return** – If you choose a plane you’re already on, you’re taken back to the plane you came from.  \n\n### Risks & Things to Consider\n- **Limited use** – Only once per day.  You can’t “keep jumping” if you need to travel repeatedly.  \n- **No safety net** – The amulet does not guarantee safe conditions on the destination plane.  You may arrive in hostile territory, without magic, or in a place where your gear functions differently.  \n- **Prerequisite – Prior Visit** – You cannot teleport to a brand‑new plane.  If you want to explore a plane you haven’t been to yet, you’ll need another means (e.g., a *plane shift* spell).  \n- **Plane‑specific restrictions** – Some planes forbid planar travel outright; the amulet simply won’t work there.  \n- **No inherent damage or side‑effects** – The amulet itself has no magical hazard (no alignment shift, no damage, no curse) beyond the normal dangers of being in a different plane.  \n\n> **Bottom line:** The Amulet of the Planes is a handy, one‑shot “ready‑made” teleport that lets you and a small party instantly jump to a familiar plane—great for a quick escape, surprise attack, or sudden rendezvous—but it’s a once‑per‑day tool that only works to places you’ve already seen, and it offers no protection against the risks of the destination plane.", "reference": "The Amulet of the Planes is a very rare wondrous item that requires attunement.

Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).

In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead. Arrow of Slaying Weapon (arrow), very rare An arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both arrows of dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common. Bag of Beans Wondrous item, rare Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains. If you dump the bag’s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation. If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue’s Fast Hands can’t be used to activate the item. Command Word A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can’t be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell. Consumables Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. Spells Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item’s description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don’t have a spellcasting ability-perhaps you’re a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature-your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply. Charges Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained. check.

However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.

Bag of Holding Wondrous item, uncommon This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again.

If you don’t have a spellcasting ability-perhaps you’re a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature-your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply. Charges Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties.

Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained. check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn’t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed. Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane. If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane. Bag of Holding Wondrous item, uncommon This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate. Placing a bag of holdinginside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack , portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.

The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance). Arrow-Catching Shield Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement) You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead. Arrow of Slaying Weapon (arrow), very rare An arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both arrows of dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one. Once an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow. Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common. Bag of Beans Wondrous item, rare Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains. If you dump the bag’s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect. d100 Effect 01 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary hit po ints for 1 hour. 02 - 10 A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds. 11 - 20 A treant sprouts. There’s a 50 percent chance that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks. 21 - 30 An animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the s ame plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours. 31 - 40 A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished). 41 - 50 1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout 51 - 60 1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM’s choice. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke. 61 - 70 A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks. 71 - 80 A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM’s choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days. 81 - 90 A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion. 91-99 A pyramid with a 60-- foot-- square base bursts upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the mummy lord’s lair, and its sarcophagus con ta ins treasure of the GM’s choice. 00 A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM’s choice. The top leads where the GM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant’s castle, or a different plane of existence. Bag of Devouring Wondrous item, very rare This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice. The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag.

(the bag’s internal space is a 5‑ft diameter sphere that can hold up to 64 cu ft.).\n* **Overload** – Exceeding either the volume or weight limit causes the bag to *burst*.

Interaction Between Bag of Holding and Bag of Devouring\n\n| Scenario | Result |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Bag of Devouring inside a Bag of Holding** | Allowed. The Bag of Holding simply contains the Bag of Devouring. The devouring effect works on non‑magical items that you place directly into the Devouring bag; items you put into the Bag of Holding (outside the Devouring bag) are safe. |\n| **Bag of Holding inside a Bag of Devouring** | Not allowed. The Bag of Holding is a *magic item*, so the Devouring bag would not devour it, but the rules state you cannot place an extradimensional container inside another extradimensional container. If you try, the bag of holding will burst and the Devouring bag is destroyed. |\n| **Overfilling the Bag of Holding** | The bag bursts, destroying everything inside – this includes the Bag of Devouring. |\n| **Overfilling the Bag of Devouring** | The bag bursts, destroying the devoured matter and any items you put directly into it. The Bag of Holding inside it is unaffected unless the burst also ruptures the outer bag. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The only safe way to combine them is to *carry* a Bag of Devouring inside a Bag of Holding. Items you want to protect must go into the Bag of Holding, not directly into the Devouring bag.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Handy Haversack\n\n*PHB 140*\n\n* **Activation** – Pull an item out of the pouch.

(the interior can hold up to 5 cu ft. of volume and 50 lb. of weight).\n* **Overload** – Overfilling causes the hole to *implode*, destroying the hole and all contents.\n* **Restrictions** – **Cannot be placed inside any extradimensional container** (including a Bag of Holding).  If a Bag of Holding is placed inside a Portable Hole, the *Bag of Holding is destroyed* (the rules explicitly note this catastrophic interaction).  The Portable Hole can be placed inside a Bag of Holding, but then the bag’s interior space is filled by the hole; the bag can still hold other items that fit inside the hole’s 5 cu ft. space.\n* **Special note** – A Portable Hole is a sheet of cloth; it’s not a “pouch” and items must be dropped into it from outside.  It’s a convenient way to transport a lot of bulk quickly.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Uncertainties & Sources\n\n* The **exact weight limit** of the Bag of Devouring (5 lb.) is taken from DMG 128, but the text sometimes mentions “any non‑magical item” without specifying weight; the DMG’s wording is clear that the bag has a 5‑lb. limit.\n* The **interaction between a Portable Hole and a Bag of Holding** is a point of discussion in the 5e FAQ. The DMG explicitly says that placing a Bag of Holding inside a Portable Hole results in both being destroyed. The reverse (Portable Hole inside a Bag of Holding) is allowed but simply occupies the bag’s interior; this is the standard interpretation in most 5e circles.\n* **Handy Haversack** rules (PHB 140) are consistent across all official sources; the pouch’s “magnetic” retrieval is a special feature but has no impact on the overload rule.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line for a GM or player:**  \n- **Put the Bag of Devouring inside a Bag of Holding** if you want a “backup” container that will chew up any non‑magical loot you accidentally drop in.  \n- **Never place an extradimensional container inside another extradimensional container** unless the rules explicitly allow it (the only official allowance is a Portable Hole inside a Bag of Holding).  \n- **Check volume and weight** for each item; overfilling any of them causes a catastrophic burst that destroys everything inside, so be mindful of the totals when packing.", "reference": "Bag of Holding is a wondrous item that has no activation requirement; it simply functions as a container.

The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation. If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue’s Fast Hands can’t be used to activate the item. Command Word A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can’t be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell. Consumables Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. Spells Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item’s description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item.

The *Bag of Holding* simply provides a “safe” space for items—it doesn’t negate or modify the magic that the devouring bag applies to things it encloses.\n\n## What actually happens\n\n1. **You put the devouring bag in the holding bag.**  \n   - The devouring bag is now an item inside the *Bag of Holding*’s extradimensional space.  \n   - It can still be opened, and any non‑magical items you slide into it will be devoured as normal.\n\n2. **If you then put non‑magical items into the devouring bag:**  \n   - They’re consumed by the devouring bag’s magic, even though the bag is inside the *Bag of Holding*.\n\n3. **If you try to overfill the devouring bag:**  \n   - The devouring bag will still try to consume everything until it reaches its limit.  \n   - If it overflows, the rules for “over‑filled” bags (DMG § 141) apply, potentially destroying the bag itself—whether it’s inside or outside a *Bag of Holding*.\n\n4. **Does the holding bag protect the devoured items?**  \n   - No. The holding bag’s extradimensional space is separate from the devouring bag’s internal space. The devouring bag does not “know” it’s inside another container; it simply consumes what’s inside it.\n\n## Edge cases & DM discretion\n\n- **Can you overfill the *Bag of Holding* with a devouring bag?**  \n  The *Bag of Holding* has a 500‑lb limit. The devouring bag is typically small enough that you won’t hit that limit by simply placing the bag inside. However, if you somehow over‑fill the *Bag of Holding* (e.g., by stuffing it with other items in addition to the devouring bag), the standard rules for a *Bag of Holding* rupture apply.\n\n- **What if you want to hide the devouring bag?**  \n  The *Bag of Holding* provides concealment, but the bag’s magic still functions. A creature could discover the devouring bag by opening the *Bag of Holding* and seeing it.\n\n- **Is there a rule that says one bag can’t be inside another?**  \n  The DMG only forbids putting a *Bag of Holding* inside another *Bag of Holding* (or another extradimensional bag of the same type). A *Bag of Devouring* isn’t that type, so it can be nested safely.\n\n## Bottom line\n\n- The *Bag of Devouring* keeps devouring items inside it, no matter where the bag itself is stored.  \n- The *Bag of Holding* does not protect the items from the devouring effect.  \n- If you ever put the devouring bag inside the holding bag, the devouring bag remains fully active; the only thing the holding bag protects is the *bag itself* from external threats (unless the devouring bag’s magic also attacks it).\n\n**DM note:** The 5e rules are silent on any interaction that might mitigate the devouring effect, so a DM’s judgment is required only in edge‑case scenarios (e.g., trying to overfill both bags). In typical play, the devouring bag behaves the same inside or outside a *Bag of Holding*.", "reference": "According to the context, a Bag of Holding is a wondrous item that can hold up to 500 pounds and 64 cubic feet of material, and it can hold items inside its extradimensional space. A Bag of Devouring is a very rare wondrous item that superficially resembles a Bag of Holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Anything that is animal or vegetable matter placed wholly inside the Bag of Devouring is devoured and lost forever, and if part of a living creature is placed inside, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside. If you place a Bag of Devouring inside a Bag of Holding, the Bag of Holding will simply hold the Bag of Devouring in its extradimensional space. The Bag of Devouring will still function normally inside the Bag of Holding, devouring any matter that is put into it. The Bag of Holding can be overloaded, pierced, or torn, which would destroy it and scatter its contents in the Astral Plane, but the Bag of Devouring itself is not destroyed by being inside the Bag of Holding unless the Bag of Holding is overloaded or pierced.

Deck of Illusions Wondrous item, uncommon This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards. The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you. An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm.

Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once. Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.\n\nDemon Armor\nArmor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor’s clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.\nCurse.Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t doff it unless you are targeted by the\nremove curse\nspell or similar magic.

The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.  You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.\n\nDragon Scale Mail\nArmor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement) Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.  While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).  Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor.

When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon’s type. For the purpose of this weapon, “dragon” refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.\n\nDust of Disappearance\nWondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed\nwhen its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.\n\nDust of Dryness\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.\nSomeone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.\nAn elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nDust of Sneezing and Choking\nWondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be\ndust of disappearance, and an\nidentifyspell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.\nWhen you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The\nlesser restoration\nspell can also end the effect on a creature.\n\nDwarven Plate\nArmor (plate), very rare While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, if an effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can use your reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.\n\nDwarven Thrower\nWeapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement by a dwarf) You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.\n\nEfficient Quiver\nWondrous item, uncommon Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.  You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.\n\nEfreeti Bottle\nWondrous item, very rare This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efre eti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.  The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.\nd100                                                                                                    Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n01-10                                                                                                   The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5  rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle  loses its magic.                                                                                                                                          \n11 - 90                                                                                                 The efreeti serves you for  1 hour, doing as you  command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle,  and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can’t  be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the  bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the  \nbottle is opened a fourth time, the efre eti  escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its  magic.  \n91 - 00                                                                                                 The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for  you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or  after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.                                                                                                  \n\n\nElemental Gem\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the\nconjure elemental\nspell, and the gem’s magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.\nGem             Summoned Elemental  \nBlue sapphire   Air elemental       \nYellow diamond  Earth elemental     \nRed corundum    Fire elemental      \nEmerald         Water elemental     \n\n\nElven Chain\nArmor (chain shirt), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.\n\nEversmoking Bottle\nWondrous item, uncommon\nSmoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud’s area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.\nThe cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.\n\nEyes of Charming\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the\ncharm personspell\n(save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nEyes of Minute Seeing\nWondrous item, uncommon These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.\n\nEyes of the Eagle\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.\n\nFeather Token\nWondrous item, rare This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.\nd100     Feather Token  d100     Feather Token  \n01 - 20  Anchor         51 - 65  Swan boat      \n21 - 35  Bird           66 - 90  Tree           \n36 - 50  Fan            91 - 00  Whip           \n\nAnchor. You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.\nBird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can’t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.\nFan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.\nSwan Boat.You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.\nTree.You must be outdoors to use this token.You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\nWhip.You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after\n1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.\n\nFigurine of Wondrous Power\nWondrous item, rarity by figurine\nA figurine of wondrous poweris a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no\ncommands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.  The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.\nBronze Griffon (Rare).

The throw uses the hammer’s normal damage dice (2 d6) and has a normal thrown‑weapon range of 20 / 60 ft.  The throw is not a *special* action; it’s treated as an attack. |\n| **Alignment‑dependent extra damage** | If the target is **evil** the hammer deals **+2 d4 radiant** damage instead of the usual 2 d4 fire damage.  If the target is not evil, the hammer deals +2 d4 fire damage. |\n| **Other notes** | The hammer is *legendary*, so it can be used by any character who can wield a warhammer, but it’s especially prized by dwarves.  No special “recharge” or “once per day” limit; the extra damage simply applies to every attack with the weapon. |\n\n### How it works in combat\n\n1. **Equip** – You wield the hammer as a one‑handed warhammer (you can still use a shield or a second hand for other items).  \n2. **Attack** – On your turn, you can choose to use the hammer in a melee attack or throw it.  \n   * **Melee**: Attack roll +3 (to hit), damage 2 d6 + 3 + (2 d4 fire or radiant, depending on the target’s alignment).  \n   * **Throw**: Attack roll +3 (to hit) against the target’s AC at a range of 20/60 ft. Damage is the same as a melee attack: 2 d6 + 3 + 2 d4 fire/ radiant.  The thrown hammer behaves like a normal thrown weapon; you cannot use it for a “special” attack like a shove unless the DM allows it.  \n3. **Ranged use** – Because it’s a thrown weapon, you can use it to hit enemies out of reach or from a distance, and the extra damage is applied just as in melee.\n\n### Typical damage output\n\n- **Normal target**: 2 d6 + 3 (hit bonus) + 2 d4 fire.  \n  *Average damage*: 7 (2 d6) + 3 + 5 (2 d4) ≈ **15** damage per hit.  \n- **Evil target**: 2 d6 + 3 + 2 d4 radiant.  \n  *Average damage*: ~**15** damage per hit (same average, but radiant instead of fire).\n\nSo the Dwarven Thrower gives a dwarf (or any character) a powerful +3 warhammer that can also be hurled, with a nice extra burst of fire (or radiant) damage that triggers automatically against evil foes.", "reference": "Dwarven Thrower is a very rare warhammer that a dwarf must attune to.

The cube extends 10 ft in all directions from the creature, so the creature is locked inside that space.  \n   * The cage **prevents the creature from leaving the cube**. It cannot move out, nor can it be moved by other means (including teleportation, the *shift* spell, *move through* effects, or any other displacement).  \n   * The creature can still use its actions, cast spells, and otherwise act normally, but it cannot change its location.  \n4. **Escape** – While restrained, the creature may **use an action to attempt a Strength check** against your spell‑save DC.

If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed.

Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.  Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.\n\nHorn of Valhalla\nWondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron) You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker.They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.  Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn’s type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn’s type or determines it randomly.\nd100   Horn  Type  Berserkers  Summoned  Requirement                            \n01-40  Silver      2d4 + 2               None                                   \n41-75  Brass       3d4 + 3               Proficiency with all  simple weapons   \n76-90  Bronze      4d4 + 4               Proficiency with all  medium armor     \n91-00  Iron        5d4 + 5               Proficiency with all  martial weapons  \n\nIf you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.\n\nHorseshoes of a Zephyr\nWondrous item, very rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.\n\nHorseshoes of Speed\nWondrous item, rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature’s walking speed by 30 feet.\n\nImmovable Rod\nRod, uncommon\nThis flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.\n\nInstant Fortress\nWondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.\nThe fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the\nknockspell and similar magic, such as that of a\nchime of opening.\nEach creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.  The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.\n\nIoun Stone\nWondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement) An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color. When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.  A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.\nAbsorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.  Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nAgility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.\nAwareness (Rare). You can’t be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nFortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.\nGreater Absorption (Legendary).While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\nOnce the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nInsight (Very Rare).Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.\nIntellect (Very Rare).Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.\nLeadership (Very Rare).Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.\nMastery (Legendary).Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.\nProtection (Rare).You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.\nRegeneration (Legendary).You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.\nReserve (Rare).This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\nStrength (Very Rare).Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nSustenance (Rare).You don’t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.\n\nIron Bands of Binding\nWondrous item, rare This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.  Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.  A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.  Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nIron Flask\nWondrous item, legendary This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.  You can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.  An identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.\nd100     Contents           \n1 r 50   Empty              \n51 r 54  Demon (type 1)     \n55 r 58  Demon (type 2)     \n59 r 62  Demon (type 3)     \n63 r 64  Demon (type 4)     \n65       Demon (type 5)     \n66       Demon (type 6)     \n67       Deva               \n68 r 69  Devil (greater)    \n70 r 73  Devil (lesser)     \n74 r 75  Djinni             \n76 r 77  Efreeti            \n78 r 83  Elemental (any)    \n84 r 86  Invisible stalker  \n87 r 90  Night hag          \n91       Planetar           \n92 r 95  Salamander         \n96       Solar              \n97 r 99  Succubus/incubus   \n100      Xorn               \n\n\nJavelin of Lightning\nWeapon (javelin), uncommon\nThis javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.\nThe javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.\n\nLantern of Revealing\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern’s bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.\n\nLuck Blade\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement) You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.\nLuck. If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nWish. The sword has 1d4 - 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the wish spell from it. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.\n\nMace of Disruption\nWeapon (mace), rare (requires attunement) When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.  While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\n\nMace of Smiting\nWeapon (mace), rare You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the mace to attack a construct.  When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage if it’s a construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.\n\nMace of Terror\nWeapon (mace), rare (requires attunement) This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nThe mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nMantle of Spell Resistance\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.\n\nManual of Bodily Health\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Constitution score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nManual of Gainful Exercise\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nManual of Golems\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can’t use a\nmanual of golemsand attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.\nd20      Golem  Time      Cost        \n1 - 5    Clay   30 days   65,000 gp   \n6 - 17   Flesh  60 days   50,000 gp   \n18       Iron   120 days  100,000 gp  \n19 - 20  Stone  90 days   80,000 gp   \n\nTo create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.  Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.\n\nManual of Quickness of Action\nWondrous item, very rare This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nMarvelous Pigments\nWondrous item, very rare Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.   Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons-that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.  When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.  Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.  If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.\n\nMedallion of Thoughts\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThe medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the\ndetect thoughtsspell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nMirror of Life Trapping\nWondrous item, very rare\nWhen this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.\nIf the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.\nAny creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature\nis confined to the cell until freed.\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.\nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature\ntrapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.\n"], "response": "**Helm of Telepathy – quick reference**\n\n| Feature | What it does | How to use it | Recharge |\n|---------|--------------|---------------|----------|\n| **Attunement** | The helm is a *rare* magic item.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.\nThe hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.\nPlacing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.\nThe haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right\nbefore it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\n\nHat of Disguise\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the disguise self spell from it at will. The spell ends if the hat is removed.\n\nHeadband of Intellect\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) Your Intelligence score is 19 while you wear this headband. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is already 19 or higher.\n\nHelm of Brilliance\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic. You gain the following benefits while wearing it:\n•You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm’s gems of the specified type as a component:\ndaylight(opal), fireball (fire opal), prismatic spray(diamond), or wall of fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.\n•As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.\n•As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.\n•As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, youcan use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-footradius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Theflames are harmless to you and the weapon. Whenyou hit with an attack using the blazing weapon,the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.\nRoll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its\ngems are then destroyed.\n\nHelm of Comprehending Languages\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the\ncomprehend languagesspell from it at will.\n\nHelm of Telepathy\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the\ndetect thoughtsspell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply-using\na bonus action to do so-while your focus on it continues.\nWhile focusing on a creature with detect thoughts, you can use an action to cast the\nsuggestion spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the\nsuggestionproperty can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nHelm of Teleportation\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the\nteleportspell from it. The helm regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nHoly Avenger\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement by a paladin)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage.\nWhile you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage\non saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.\n\nHorn of Blasting\nWondrous item, rare You can use an action to speak the horn’s command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.  Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.\n\nHorn of Valhalla\nWondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron) You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker.They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.  Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn’s type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn’s type or determines it randomly.\nd100   Horn  Type  Berserkers  Summoned  Requirement                            \n01-40  Silver      2d4 + 2               None                                   \n41-75  Brass       3d4 + 3               Proficiency with all  simple weapons   \n76-90  Bronze      4d4 + 4               Proficiency with all  medium armor     \n91-00  Iron        5d4 + 5               Proficiency with all  martial weapons  \n\nIf you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.\n\nHorseshoes of a Zephyr\nWondrous item, very rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.\n\nHorseshoes of Speed\nWondrous item, rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature’s walking speed by 30 feet.\n\nImmovable Rod\nRod, uncommon\nThis flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.\n\nInstant Fortress\nWondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.\nThe fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the\nknockspell and similar magic, such as that of a\nchime of opening.\nEach creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.  The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.\n\nIoun Stone\nWondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement) An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color. When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.  A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.\nAbsorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.  Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nAgility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.\nAwareness (Rare). You can’t be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nFortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.\nGreater Absorption (Legendary).While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\nOnce the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nInsight (Very Rare).Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.\nIntellect (Very Rare).Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.\nLeadership (Very Rare).Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.\nMastery (Legendary).Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.\nProtection (Rare).You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.\nRegeneration (Legendary).You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.\nReserve (Rare).This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\nStrength (Very Rare).Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nSustenance (Rare).You don’t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.\n\nIron Bands of Binding\nWondrous item, rare This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.  Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.  A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.  Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nIron Flask\nWondrous item, legendary This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.  You can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.  An identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.\nd100     Contents           \n1 r 50   Empty              \n51 r 54  Demon (type 1)     \n55 r 58  Demon (type 2)     \n59 r 62  Demon (type 3)     \n63 r 64  Demon (type 4)     \n65       Demon (type 5)     \n66       Demon (type 6)     \n67       Deva               \n68 r 69  Devil (greater)    \n70 r 73  Devil (lesser)     \n74 r 75  Djinni             \n76 r 77  Efreeti            \n78 r 83  Elemental (any)    \n84 r 86  Invisible stalker  \n87 r 90  Night hag          \n91       Planetar           \n92 r 95  Salamander         \n96       Solar              \n97 r 99  Succubus/incubus   \n100      Xorn               \n\n\nJavelin of Lightning\nWeapon (javelin), uncommon\nThis javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.\nThe javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.\n\nLantern of Revealing\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern’s bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.\n\nLuck Blade\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement) You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.\nLuck. If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nWish. The sword has 1d4 - 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the wish spell from it. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.\n\nMace of Disruption\nWeapon (mace), rare (requires attunement) When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.  While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\n\nMace of Smiting\nWeapon (mace), rare You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the mace to attack a construct.  When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage if it’s a construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.\n\nMace of Terror\nWeapon (mace), rare (requires attunement) This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nThe mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nMantle of Spell Resistance\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.\n\nManual of Bodily Health\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Constitution score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nManual of Gainful Exercise\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nManual of Golems\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can’t use a\nmanual of golemsand attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.\nd20      Golem  Time      Cost        \n1 - 5    Clay   30 days   65,000 gp   \n6 - 17   Flesh  60 days   50,000 gp   \n18       Iron   120 days  100,000 gp  \n19 - 20  Stone  90 days   80,000 gp   \n\nTo create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.  Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.\n\nManual of Quickness of Action\nWondrous item, very rare This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\n\nMarvelous Pigments\nWondrous item, very rare Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.   Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons-that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.  When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.  Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.  If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.\n\nMedallion of Thoughts\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThe medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the\ndetect thoughtsspell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nMirror of Life Trapping\nWondrous item, very rare\nWhen this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.\nIf the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.\nAny creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature\nis confined to the cell until freed.\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.\nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature\ntrapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.\n"], "response": "**Holy Avenger (sword)**  \n*From the 5th‑edition DMG (or Essentials)*  \n\n| Feature | Effect (vs. fiends or undead) |\n|---------|------------------------------|\n| **+3 bonus** | Adds +3 to attack and damage rolls, like any +3 weapon. |\n| **Extra radiant damage** | When the wielder hits a fiend or undead with a melee attack, the hit deals an additional **2d8 radiant damage** (in addition to the weapon’s normal damage). |\n| **Advantage on Charisma checks** | While the paladin is wielding the sword, he has **advantage on all Charisma (Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation) checks against fiends and undead**. |\n| **No aura** | The Holy Avenger itself does not grant an aura; its effects are limited to the weapon. |\n\nSo in a fight against a fiend or undead, a paladin wielding a Holy Avenger will hit harder (2d8 extra radiant damage) and can negotiate or frighten those foes more easily because of the Charisma‑check advantage.\n\n---\n\n### Paladin’s Aura\n\nThe “aura” you’re referring to is a **class feature of the Paladin** (not a property of the Holy Avenger).

Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top. The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.

Its contents, including the haversack, are no longer in the bag’s extra‑dimensional space. |\n| **Haversack** | *Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount* (or DMG variant): “A haversack is a small extradimensional bag that can hold up to 20 lb (or 5 cu ft).” | The haversack is not an independent extradimensional container when it’s inside a bag of holding. When the bag of holding collapses, the haversack is simply an ordinary item that has been “thrown out” of the bag’s interior. Its own extradimensional space (if any) is still intact, but because it’s no longer in the bag’s interior, it can’t be used on the Astral Plane. The haversack’s contents are lost. |\n\n### Practical consequence\n\n1. **Bag of holding** – The bag’s extradimensional storage disappears. The bag itself is turned into a normal 10‑ft‑cube of cloth (likely damaged).  \n2. **Haversack inside it** – The haversack is “released” from the bag’s interior and, because the bag’s space is no longer usable, the haversack’s contents vanish. The haversack itself remains as a normal item on the Astral Plane, but it can’t be opened or used; it’s just a pouch on the Astral.  \n3. **All items that were inside the haversack** – Those items are lost. The rules do not give a “save” for items inside a nested bag that is being moved off‑plane.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line for players\n\n*Never* put a *haversack* (or any other extradimensional bag) inside a *bag of holding* if you plan to travel off‑plane. The safest way to keep your items safe on the Astral is to carry them in a normal bag or to keep them on the Material Plane. If you’ve already slipped a haversack into a bag of holding and you’re heading to the Astral, expect that both the bag of holding and the haversack will lose their magical properties and that everything inside will be lost.", "reference": "If you put the haversack inside an extradimensional space like a bag of holding, both items are destroyed and a one‑way gate to the Astral Plane opens where the haversack was placed.

A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.\n\nNecklace of Adaptation\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).\n\nNecklace of Fireballs\nWondrous item, rare This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireballspell (save DC 15).  You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.\n\nNecklace of Prayer Beads\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin) This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.  Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nd20      Bead of …      Spell                                          \n1-6      Blessing       Bless                                          \n7-12     Curing         Cure wounds (2nd level) or lesser restoration  \n13 - 16  Favor          Greater restoration                            \n17 - 18  Smiting        Branding smite                                 \n19       Summons        Planar ally                                    \n20       Wind  walking  Wind walk                                      \n\n\nNine Lives Stealer\nWeapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.\n\nOathbow\nWeapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, “Swift death to you who have\nwronged me.” The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.\nWhen you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.\nWhile your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.\n\nOil of Etherealness\nPotion, rare\nBeads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional\nvial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.\n\nOil of Sharpness\nPotion, very rare This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultra thin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.\n\nOil of Slipperiness\nPotion, uncommon This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.  Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.\n\nPearl of Power\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster) While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can`t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nPeriapt of Health\nWondrous item, uncommon You are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant. If you are already infected with a disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed you while you wear the pendant.\n\nPeriapt of Proof against Poison\nWondrous item, rare This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant.

In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.\n\nPhilter of Love\nPotion, uncommon\nThe next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion’s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.\n\nPipes of Haunting\nWondrous item, uncommon\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nPipes of the Sewers\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.\nThe pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called\nswarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.  Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’ music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours.\n\nPlate Armor of Etherealness\nArmor (plate), legendary (requires attunement) While you’re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nPortable Hole\nWondrous item, rare This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.  If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the\nportable holeor the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed\nportable holecan survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable holeinside an extradimensional space created by a\nbag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\n\nPotion of Animal Friendship\nPotion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you can cast the animal friendship\nspell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.\n\nPotion of Clairvoyance\nPotion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the\nclairvoyancespell. An eyeball bobs in this yellowish liquid but vanishes when the potion is opened.\n\nPotion of Climbing\nPotion, common\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour.

Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.\n\nPotion of Diminution\nPotion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the\nenlarge/reducespell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\n\nPotion of Flying\nPotion, very rare When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you’re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potion’s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.\n\nPotion of Gaseous Form\nPotion, rare When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous form spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion’s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.\n\nPotion of Giant Strength\nPotion, rarity varies When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.  This potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone giant strength have the same effect.\nType of Giant      Strength  Rarity     \nHill giant         21        Uncommon   \nFrost/stone giant  23        Rare       \nFire giant         25        Rare       \nCloud giant        27        Very rare  \nStorm giant        29        Legendary  \n\n\nPotion of Growth\nPotion, uncommon When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\n\nPotion of Healing\nPotion, rarity varies You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion’s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion’s red liquid glimmers when agitated.\n\nPotions of Healing\nPotion of …       Rarity     HP Regained  \nHealing           Common     2d4 + 2      \nGreater healing   Uncommon   4d4 + 4      \nSuperior healing  Rare       8d4 + 8      \nSupreme healing   Very rare  10d4 + 20    \n\n\nPotion of Heroism\nPotion, rare\nFor 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the\nblessspell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.\n\nPotion of Invisibility\nPotion, very rare\nThis potion’s container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.\n\nPotion of Mind Reading\nPotion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the\ndetect thoughtsspell (save DC 13). The potion’s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.\n\nPotion of Poison\nPotion, uncommon\nThis concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of healing\nor other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An\nidentify\nspell reveals its true nature.\nIf you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13\nConstitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.\n\nPotion of Resistance\nPotion, uncommon When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage for 1 hour. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.\nd10  Damage Type  d10  Damage Type  \n1    Acid         6    Necrotic     \n2    Cold         7    Poison       \n3    Fire         8    Psychic      \n4    Force        9    Radiant      \n5    Lightning    10   Thunder      \n\n\nPotion of Speed\nPotion, very rare When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the haste spell for 1 minute (no concentration required).

The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be poisoned, and is cured of any disease.\n\nRing of Animal Influence\nRing, rare This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells:\n•Animal friendship (save DC 13)\n•Fear (save DC 13), targeting only beasts that havean Intelligence of 3 or lower\n•Speak with animals\n\nRing of Djinni Summoning\nRing, legendary (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this ring, you can speak its command word as an action to summon a particular djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air. The djinni appears in\nan unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.\nWhile summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use.

The gem in the ring indicates the type, which the GM chooses or determines randomly.\nd10  Damage Type  Gem         \n1    Acid         Pearl       \n2    Cold         Tourmaline  \n3    Fire         Garnet      \n4    Force        Sapphire    \n5    Lightning    Citrine     \n6    Necrotic     Jet         \n7    Poison       Amethyst    \n8    Psychic      Jade        \n9    Radiant      Topaz       \n10   Thunder      Spinel      \n\n\nRing of Shooting Stars\nRing, very rare (requires attunement outdoors at night) While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast dancing lights and light from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.  The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.\nFaerie Fire. You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast faerie fire from the ring.\nBall Lightning. You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.  Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.\nAs a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.\nSpheres  Lightning Damage  \n4        2d4               \n3        2d6               \n2        5d4               \n1        4d12              \n\nShooting Stars.You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nRing of Spell Storing\nRing, rare (requires attunement)\nThis ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell\nis cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\n\nRing of Spell Turning\nRing, legendary (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.\n\nRing of Swimming\nRing, uncommon You have a swimming speed of 40 feet while wearing this ring.\n\nRing of Telekinesis\nRing, very rare (requires attunement) While wearing this ring, you can cast the telekinesisspell at will, but you can target only objects that aren’t being worn or carried.\n\nRing of the Ram\nRing, rare (requires attunement) This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring produces a spectral ram’s head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.  Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring’s charges as an action to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn’t being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.\n\nRing of Three Wishes\nRing, legendary While wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the wish spell from it. The ring becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge.\n\nRing of Warmth\nRing, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing this ring, you have resistance to cold damage. In addition, you and everything you wear and carry are unharmed by temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nRing of Water Walking\nRing, uncommon While wearing this ring, you can stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground.\n\nRing of X-ray Vision\nRing, rare (requires attunement) While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.\nWhenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.\n"], "response": "**Periapt of Health**  \n*DMG 212 – Uncommon (non‑attuned magic item)*  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Official Description  \n> *“A silver disc that bears faint, blue‑tinged runes. You have advantage on any saving throw against a disease, and you are immune to disease.”*\n\nThe item is a small, flat, round piece of polished silver (≈1 in. in diameter). Its surface glows with a soft, pulsing blue when the bearer is exposed to a disease or when a disease is cast upon the wearer.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Core Properties\n\n| Feature | Effect |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Uncommon** | The item is available in moderate‑rich treasure hoards, or as a reward from a knowledgeable NPC. |\n| **Non‑Attuned** | Anyone may benefit; no attunement is required, so multiple party members can share it. |\n| **Disease Immunity** | The bearer cannot be affected by any disease. The disease cannot take hold, and any disease‑related effects are negated. |\n| **Advantage on Saves vs. Disease** | If a disease’s effect is already in place (e.g., a disease that has a *save to resist* component), the bearer takes advantage on the roll, giving a 50 % increase in the chance to succeed. |\n| **No Suppression** | The Periapt of Health **does not** provide a suppression or removal effect. That ability belongs to the *Periapt of Wound Closure* (which has a bonus‑action suppression feature). |\n\n> **Note**: Some home‑brew or older 3.x materials described a suppression feature; the 5e rules do not. If you want suppression, use a *Periapt of Wound Closure* instead.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Lore & Flavor\n\n* **Origin**: According to the *Dungeon Master’s Guide* footnote, the Periapt of Health is a relic of the Healing Cult of the goddess *Syrin*, who taught that “a healthy body is the first step toward a righteous soul.” The cult’s temples are often found near plague‑affected regions; the items they forged were meant to protect their followers in dangerous missions.\n\n* **Appearance**: The silver disc is etched with a stylized serpent coiling around a stylized human heart. Where the serpent’s eyes are, faint blue filaments glow, a testament to the item's protective power.\n\n* **Tradition**: The Periapt is often passed down in families of healers, physicians, or rangers. A legendary “Silver Heart” is said to be the original of the modern item; it survived the Great Plague in the city of Vael, saving countless lives.\n\n---\n\n### 4. How It Functions in Gameplay\n\n1. **Pre‑encounter**: The party can acquire the Periapt and immediately be safe from any known disease threats (e.g., a poisoned goblin that spreads disease, a cursed forest, or a plague‑infested town).\n\n2. **During combat**: If a DM attempts to spread a disease as part of a spell or monster attack, the bearer automatically succeeds on the saving throw (advantage). If the disease requires a save to activate (e.g., *Vampiric Touch* or *Blight*), the bearer will almost certainly avoid the effect.\n\n3. **Out‑of‑combat**: In towns or villages with quarantines, the bearer can enter without fear of contamination, opening storylines (e.g., an uninfected envoy can speak to a plague‑suffering elder).\n\n4. **Stacking**: Two Periapt of Health items do not stack additional benefits (each already grants immunity). However, you can pair it with a *Periapt of Wound Closure* or a *Ring of Protection* for extra safety.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Creative Narrative Uses\n\n| Scenario | How the Periapt Adds Flavor |\n|----------|-----------------------------|\n| **Ritual of the Healing Temple** | A priest offers the Periapt as a symbol of the temple’s promise: “We will guard you as we heal the sick.” |\n| **Escape from a Plague Town** | The bearer steps into a quarantined zone while the rest of the party must wait outside. The Periapt becomes a bargaining chip with city guards. |\n| **Ancient Prophecy** | An oracle predicts that a “silver heart” will prevent the spread of a looming apocalypse. The party’s quest is to locate the original relic. |\n| **Moral Dilemma** | The party finds a village where the disease has turned the infected into “living wards.” Do they use the Periapt to protect themselves while helping the villagers? |\n| **Heroic Sacrifice** | The bearer can offer the Periapt to a dying ally to save them from a disease, creating a poignant moment. |\n\n---\n\n### 6. Acquisition Ideas\n\n| Source | Typical Setting | DM Tips |\n|--------|-----------------|---------|\n| **Treasure Hoard** | Dungeon, ancient shrine, goblin lair | Mention the Periapt as a “glowing silver disc” hidden behind a locked door. |\n| **Reward for a Healer NPC** | A town healer’s guild, a traveling alchemist | NPC gives the item as thanks for rescuing a village from a plague. |\n| **Quest Reward** | Completion of a “Sanctuary of the Silver Heart” quest | The item is given as a reward, but the party must decide to keep it or share it. |\n| **Trade** | A wandering merchant with a collection of relics | Offer a trade: “I’ll give you this Periapt if you bring me a scroll of the disease‑bane.” |\n| **Dungeon‑Delve** | A ruined temple of the Healing Cult | The Periapt sits atop a pedestal, surrounded by ancient sigils. |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Role in Campaigns\n\n* **Plague‑Heavy Campaigns**: Provides a crucial safety net; players can focus on other challenges without constant disease checks.\n* **Exploration**: Allows safe passage through infected zones; the Periapt can be a plot device for “safe zones” or “protected sanctuaries.”\n* **Medical Themes**: Works well in campaigns that emphasize healers, physicians, or religious orders.\n* **Balance**: Since the item does not require attunement, it is accessible but still powerful enough to warrant careful use. An Uncommon item that can negate a common mechanic (disease) is impactful, but not game‑breaking on its own.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Flavorful Usage in Story\n\n1. **Guarding the Caster**: A wizard summons a disease‑spreading spell on a goblin. The wizard’s companion slides on the Periapt just before the spell hits, and the goblin’s curse fizzles. The wizard is baffled, but the companion smiles, “A silver heart saved you.”  \n2. **The Quarantine Gate**: Guards demand proof of disease immunity to cross a quarantined city wall. The party shows the Periapt, and the gate opens. Inside, a secret laboratory is revealed.  \n3. **The Lost Healer**: The party rescues an elderly healer who was marked by a deadly curse. She hands them the Periapt and says, “It was my grandmother’s, and she passed it down to keep us from dying.”  \n4. **Cursed City**: The city is plagued, and the Mayor offers the Periapt to the party if they can lift the curse. The party uses it to traverse the infected streets while they investigate the source.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Uncertainties & Clarifications\n\n* **Suppression**: The 5e rules *do not* provide a suppression effect for the Periapt of Health. If you want a suppression or removal mechanic, use a *Periapt of Wound Closure* or a *Ring of Protection* that includes a disease‑removal feature.  \n* **Attunement**: The item is explicitly stated as *non‑attuned* in the DMG. This means that anyone can use it regardless of how many other magic items they carry.  \n\n---\n\n### 10.

A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.\n\nNecklace of Adaptation\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).\n\nNecklace of Fireballs\nWondrous item, rare This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireballspell (save DC 15).  You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.\n\nNecklace of Prayer Beads\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin) This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.  Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary).

If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.\n\nOathbow\nWeapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, “Swift death to you who have\nwronged me.” The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.\nWhen you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.\nWhile your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.\n\nOil of Etherealness\nPotion, rare\nBeads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional\nvial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.\n\nOil of Sharpness\nPotion, very rare This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultra thin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.\n\nOil of Slipperiness\nPotion, uncommon This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.  Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.\n\nPearl of Power\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster) While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can`t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nPeriapt of Health\nWondrous item, uncommon You are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant. If you are already infected with a disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed you while you wear the pendant.\n\nPeriapt of Proof against Poison\nWondrous item, rare This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no effect on you. You are immune to the poisoned condition and have immunity to poison damage.\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.\n\nPhilter of Love\nPotion, uncommon\nThe next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion’s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.\n\nPipes of Haunting\nWondrous item, uncommon\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nPipes of the Sewers\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.\nThe pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called\nswarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.  Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’ music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours.\n\nPlate Armor of Etherealness\nArmor (plate), legendary (requires attunement) While you’re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nPortable Hole\nWondrous item, rare This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.  If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the\nportable holeor the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed\nportable holecan survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable holeinside an extradimensional space created by a\nbag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\n\nPotion of Animal Friendship\nPotion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you can cast the animal friendship\nspell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.\n\nPotion of Clairvoyance\nPotion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the\nclairvoyancespell. An eyeball bobs in this yellowish liquid but vanishes when the potion is opened.\n\nPotion of Climbing\nPotion, common\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into\nbrown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.\n\nPotion of Diminution\nPotion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the\nenlarge/reducespell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\n\nPotion of Flying\nPotion, very rare When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you’re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potion’s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.\n\nPotion of Gaseous Form\nPotion, rare When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous form spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion’s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.\n\nPotion of Giant Strength\nPotion, rarity varies When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.  This potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone giant strength have the same effect.\nType of Giant      Strength  Rarity     \nHill giant         21        Uncommon   \nFrost/stone giant  23        Rare       \nFire giant         25        Rare       \nCloud giant        27        Very rare  \nStorm giant        29        Legendary  \n\n\nPotion of Growth\nPotion, uncommon When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\n\nPotion of Healing\nPotion, rarity varies You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion’s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table.

At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for\nlightor DC 15 for daylight), ending the blindness on a success.\n\nRobe of Scintillating Colors\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe’s power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the effect ends.\n\nRobe of Stars\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.  Six stars, located on the robe’s upper front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of the stars and use it to cast magic missile as a 5th-level spell. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.  While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.\n\nRobe of the Archmagi\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard) This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe’s color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can’t attune to a robe of the archmagi that doesn’t correspond to your alignment. You gain these benefits while wearing the robe:\n•If you aren’t wearing armor, your base ArmorClass is 15 + your Dexterity modifier.\n•You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n•Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2.\n\nRobe of Useful Items\nWondrous item, uncommon This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment. The robe has two of each of the following patches:\n•Dagger\n•Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)\n•Steel mirror\n•10-foot pole\n•Hempen rope (50 feet, coiled)\n•Sack\nIn addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches.

The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy-not the spell itself-is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.\nWhen you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.\nIf you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.\nA newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.\n\nRod of Alertness\nRod, very rare (requires attunement) This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.\nAlertness. While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.\nSpells. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, or see invisibility.\nProtective Aura. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.  The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Lordly Might\nRod, legendary (requires attunement) This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\nSix Buttons. You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.  If you press\nbutton 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head.  If you press\nbutton 2, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  If you press\nbutton 3, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.If you press\nbutton 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press\nbutton 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\nIf you press\nbutton 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\nDrain Life.When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the\nrod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nParalyze.When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nTerrify.While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Rulership\nRod, rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its\ntrusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Security\nRod, very rare While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.  For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).  When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can’t be used again until ten days have passed.\n\nRope of Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.  If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\n\nRope of Entanglement\nWondrous item, rare\nThis rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving\nthrow or become restrained.\nYou can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\n\nScarab of Protection\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)\nIf you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:\n•You have advantage on saving throws against spells.\n•The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, youcan use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.\n\nScimitar of Speed\nWeapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.\n\nShield, +1, +2, or +3\nArmor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield’s rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.\n\nShield of Missile Attraction\nArmor (shield), rare (requires attunement) While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.\nCurse. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.\n\nSlippers of Spider Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.\n\nSovereign Glue\nWondrous item, legendary This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.  One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness, or with a wish spell.\n\nSpell Scroll\nScroll, varies A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.\nIf the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.\nThe level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\n\nSpell Scroll\nSpell Level  Rarity     Save DC  Attack Bonus  \nCantrip      Common     13       +5            \n1st          Common     13       +5            \n2nd          Uncommon   13       +5            \n3rd          Uncommon   15       +7            \n4th          Rare       15       +7            \n5th          Rare       17       +9            \n6th          Very rare  17       +9            \n7th          Very rare  18       +10           \n8th          Very rare  18       +10           \n9th          Legendary  19       +11           \n\nA wizard spell on a spell scrollcan be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a\nspell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 +the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the\nspell scrollis destroyed.\n\nSpellguard Shield\nArmor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks have disadvantage against you.\n\nSphere of Annihilation\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.\nThe sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a\nsphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.\nThe sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.  If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature’s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.  If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.\nd100     Result                                                                                                                                \n01-50    The sphere is destroyed.                                                                                                              \n51 - 85  The sphere moves through the portal or into  the extradimensional space.                                                              \n86 - 00  A spatial rift sends each creature and object  within 180 feet of the sphere, including the  sphere, to a random plane of existence.  \n"], "response": "**Scimitar of Speed (5th‑edition)**  \n*(DMG, p. 266 – Rare, requires proficiency with scimitars)*  \n\n| Feature | Effect |\n|---------|--------|\n| **+1** | Adds +1 to attack rolls and to damage rolls with the scimitar. |\n| **Movement after a hit** | When you hit a creature with the scimitar, you may use a **bonus action** to move up to your speed **without provoking opportunity attacks**. |\n\n### How it plays out in combat\n\n1. **Hit to activate** – The special movement only triggers after a successful hit. If you miss, the effect doesn’t activate.  \n2. **Bonus action** – You get one bonus action per turn. If you use the scimitar’s feature, you can’t use any other bonus‑action abilities that round.  \n3. **Movement options** – You can move in any direction, use it to close distance to a foe, slip into cover, or retreat to safety, all while staying out of the reach of enemies that might otherwise trigger opportunity attacks.  \n4. **Typical tactics**  \n   * *Riposte:* Attack, hit, then move into a spot where you’re harder to hit or set up a follow‑up attack.  \n   * *Positioning:* After a hit, slide under an enemy’s guard to finish them or to switch sides.  \n   * *Escape:* Use it to run away after a successful strike when enemies are closing in.\n\nBecause the weapon’s bonus action is the only use of a bonus action, you’ll trade off any other bonus‑action benefits (e.g., a rogue’s Cunning Action, a fighter’s Action Surge‑related bonus actions, or a spellcasting bonus action). The +1 to attack and damage is a steady bonus, but the true power is the freedom to reposition immediately after an attack.\n\n**Bottom line:** The Scimitar of Speed gives you a +1 weapon and a one‑off “hit‑and‑move” bonus action that lets you move up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. It’s a great tool for mobile fighters who want to keep the pressure on while staying out of reach.", "reference": "The Scimitar of Speed is a very rare, attuned scimitar that gives a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:\n•The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n•You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\n•You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of120 feet.The eyes on the robe can’t be closed or averted.Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.\nAlightspell cast on the robe or a daylightspell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for\nlightor DC 15 for daylight), ending the blindness on a success.\n\nRobe of Scintillating Colors\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe’s power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the effect ends.\n\nRobe of Stars\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.  Six stars, located on the robe’s upper front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of the stars and use it to cast magic missile as a 5th-level spell. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.  While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.\n\nRobe of the Archmagi\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard) This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe’s color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can’t attune to a robe of the archmagi that doesn’t correspond to your alignment. You gain these benefits while wearing the robe:\n•If you aren’t wearing armor, your base ArmorClass is 15 + your Dexterity modifier.\n•You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n•Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2.\n\nRobe of Useful Items\nWondrous item, uncommon This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment. The robe has two of each of the following patches:\n•Dagger\n•Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)\n•Steel mirror\n•10-foot pole\n•Hempen rope (50 feet, coiled)\n•Sack\nIn addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches.

The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy-not the spell itself-is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.\nWhen you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.\nIf you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.\nA newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.\n\nRod of Alertness\nRod, very rare (requires attunement) This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.\nAlertness. While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.\nSpells. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, or see invisibility.\nProtective Aura. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.  The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Lordly Might\nRod, legendary (requires attunement) This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\nSix Buttons. You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.  If you press\nbutton 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head.  If you press\nbutton 2, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  If you press\nbutton 3, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.If you press\nbutton 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press\nbutton 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\nIf you press\nbutton 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\nDrain Life.When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the\nrod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nParalyze.When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nTerrify.While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Rulership\nRod, rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its\ntrusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nRod of Security\nRod, very rare While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.  For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).  When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can’t be used again until ten days have passed.\n\nRope of Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.  If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\n\nRope of Entanglement\nWondrous item, rare\nThis rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving\nthrow or become restrained.\nYou can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\n\nScarab of Protection\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)\nIf you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:\n•You have advantage on saving throws against spells.\n•The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, youcan use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.\n\nScimitar of Speed\nWeapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.\n\nShield, +1, +2, or +3\nArmor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield’s rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.\n\nShield of Missile Attraction\nArmor (shield), rare (requires attunement) While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.\nCurse. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.\n\nSlippers of Spider Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.\n\nSovereign Glue\nWondrous item, legendary This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.  One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness, or with a wish spell.\n\nSpell Scroll\nScroll, varies A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.\nIf the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully.

Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a\nsphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.\nThe sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.  If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature’s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.

The creature must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failure the creature obeys a simple command you give for the rest of its turn. | 1 charge per use; the rod starts with **3 charges** and regains 1 charge each dawn. |\n| **Ruling Presence** | While attuned, you have **advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks** made against any creature within 30 ft. | No charge cost. |\n| **Recharge** | The rod has 3 charges, regaining 1 at dawn. |\n\n> *“The command must be a single, unambiguous instruction. You may not force a creature to act against its nature or against the laws of the realm.”* – DMG (p. 200)\n\n> *“The rod does not grant control over constructs, undead, or any creature immune to mind‑affecting effects.”* – DMG (p. 200)\n\n---\n\n## Limitations (What the Rod CAN’t do)\n\n| Limitation | Why it matters |\n|------------|----------------|\n| **Limited to 1 creature/command per use** | The rod cannot force an army to move on a single command. Each target needs a separate use. |\n| **Cannot command allies or those who are already controlled** | You cannot compel a creature that is cooperating or under another effect that grants it free will. |\n| **No control over constructs, undead, or immune creatures** | These creatures ignore the command automatically. |\n| **Commands must be simple, non‑malicious, and reasonable** | You cannot force a creature to kill another or do something that would be considered “illegal” under its own moral code. |\n| **Charge limit and daily reset** | Even a master ruler can only issue a handful of absolute commands per day. |\n| **No effect on creatures with a high Wisdom** | A creature with a very high Wisdom or a high saving‑throw bonus can easily resist. |\n| **No “dominate” effect beyond the turn** | The command lasts only until the end of the creature’s next turn. It doesn’t keep them under your influence for longer periods. |\n\n---\n\n## Narrative / Flavor Ideas\n\n| Scenario | How the Rod can be used | What it feels like |\n|----------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Rallying an Army** | The ruler waves the rod and, by speaking a simple command (“Move to the ridge, guard the flanks!”), the entire army obeys. | The sound of the rod striking the ground and a ripple of authority across the battlefield. |\n| **Political Diplomacy** | In a city hall, the ruler uses the rod’s *Ruling Presence* to make an Intimidation check against the council. The council nods in deference. | A faint glow from the rod’s core as it radiates confidence. |\n| **Public Proclamation** | The ruler presses the rod to the podium and commands the crowd (“Hear the king’s decree!”). The crowd falls silent, listening. | The murmur of the crowd drops, replaced by a hush. |\n| **Enforcing Law** | A rogue tries to flee. The ruler uses the rod to command the rogue to stand still. The rogue, unable to resist, drops the loot. | The rogue’s eyes widen as a sudden chill settles. |\n| **Tension / Antagonism** | A rival faction covets the rod. The players must decide whether to use it to gain advantage or to keep it out of the wrong hands. | The rod’s surface hums ominously whenever it’s near a potential adversary. |\n| **Legacy / Heirship** | The rod is a family heirloom, said to carry the authority of an ancient dynasty. The new ruler feels the weight of the past. | A faint echo of past speeches reverberates each time the rod is wielded. |\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Using the Rod in a Campaign\n\n1. **Set a Clear Usage Threshold** – A ruler only has 3–4 “absolute commands” per day. Use this sparingly to keep the rod’s power meaningful.\n2. **Balance the Flavor with Realpolitik** – A ruler may need to use the rod to keep order, but relying on it can make them appear despotic. Have NPCs comment on this.\n3. **Introduce a Cost** – If the rod is used too often, it might attract magical backlash, create political enemies, or cause a backlash of its own (e.g., a “curse of absolute command” if overused).\n4. **Use the Intimidation Bonus** – The *Ruling Presence* bonus is a simple, mechanical way to give the ruler a subtle edge in negotiations or crowd control.\n5. **Story Hooks** – The rod could be stolen, forged, or lost. Quest lines could revolve around retrieving it, protecting it, or deciding whether to keep it.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nThe **Rod of Rulership** is a *focused, limited command device*—not a mind‑control spell, but a symbolic tool of authority that grants a ruler a few powerful, precise commands per day plus an advantage on intimidation checks. Its mechanics are simple: spend a charge, make a Wisdom save, give a clear command. Its flavor is rich: it can rally armies, enforce law, command crowds, and even become a symbol of a dynasty’s legacy. In a narrative campaign, it can serve as a plot catalyst, a symbol of power, or a source of tension—depending on how you weave it into the story.", "reference": "The Rod of Rulership is a rare item that requires attunement.

The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn’t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.\n"], "response": "**Staff of the Woodlands** – *rare, requires attunement by a druid*  \n*(Dungeon Master’s Guide p. 199, 5th edition)*  \n\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Charges** | 10 charges. |\n| **Recharge** | Regains 1d6 + 4 charges at dawn (maximum 10). |\n| **Spell‑casting cost** | 1 charge = 1st‑level spell, 2 charges = 2nd‑level, 3 charges = 3rd‑level, 4 charges = 4th‑level, 5 charges = 5th‑level. |\n| **Spell list** | *All spells are cast from the staff, consuming the charges listed above.*  <br>**1st level** – Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds, Entangle, Faerie Fire, Speak with Animals.  <br>**2nd level** – Barkskin, Lesser Restoration, Pass Without Trace, Plant Growth.  <br>**3rd level** – Call Lightning, Conjure Animals.  <br>**4th level** – Dominate Beast, Freedom of Movement, Wind Wall.  <br>**5th level** – Tree Stride. |\n| **Special properties** | • **Tree Form** – As an action, you can touch the staff and transform into a tree.

The hum can be used as a narrative cue to indicate when the staff is “ready” to cast. |\n| **Attunement & Class Restrictions** | • Attunement is possible only by bards, clerics, or druids. <br>• If a party lacks one of these classes, an NPC healer can join temporarily, or a multiclass character can be introduced. | Forces party composition decisions and can justify an NPC’s presence in the party. It also creates a “why this item matters” moment. |\n| **Statistical Snapshot** | • **Rare** (or *Very Rare* depending on the source). <br>• **Charges**: 7 (regains all after a long rest). <br>• Can cast *Cure Wounds* (1st‑level), *Heal* (3rd‑level), *Mass Cure Wounds* (3rd‑level). <br>• Each cast uses 1 charge. <br>• The staff can be used to heal a creature only if the wielder “feels a genuine need” (DM can flavor this as a roll or a narrative check). | The charge mechanic provides a tangible resource that can be tracked in the story. The “feeling a genuine need” clause allows moral dilemmas. |\n| **Narrative Hooks** | 1. **The Lost Healer** – A dying elder claims the staff was his mentor’s, and urges the party to retrieve it before the rival necromancer can corrupt it. <br>2. **Cursed Pulse** – When used to heal an enemy, the staff’s glow turns icy; the enemy remembers a secret about a hidden sanctuary. <br>3. **Song of the Sickness** – A bard discovers that a particular line of the staff’s melody can counter a plague in the city; the party must find the missing stanza in a ruined library. <br>4. **Healing Riddle** – The staff contains an inscription that can be deciphered only by someone who has completed a healing quest (e.g., healed a village, closed a rift). <br>5. **Divine Test** – The deity that forged the staff offers a boon: use the staff to heal a dying child, and the deity grants a personal boon. | Each hook ties the item to a quest, creates stakes, and can involve NPCs who may help or hinder. |\n| **Creative Story‑Telling Opportunities** | • **Healing as Narrative Currency** – Use the staff to decide whether to save an NPC in exchange for a favor or knowledge. <br>• **Moral Quandaries** – The staff refuses to heal someone with a particular alignment or from a certain culture. The party must decide whether to override the staff’s will. <br>• **Resource Management** – The party might need to split the 7 charges between several allies; this forces tension and teamwork. <br>• **Hidden Powers** – After using the staff repeatedly, a hidden rune glows, revealing a new spell (e.g., *Healing Word* or *Lesser Restoration*) that the wielder can learn. <br>• **Interaction with Religion** – The staff can be used in a sacred ritual at a temple; the DM can have the cleric perform a *Mass Healing* to appease a deity. | These mechanics become plot points, not just stats. They encourage player agency and deepen immersion. |\n| **Rule Integration for Narrative Depth** | 1. **Charge Limitation as Drama** – If the party is in a dire battle, they might run out of charges. The DM can describe the staff’s glow fading, raising stakes. <br>2. **Attunement Clues** – When a new bard/cleric/druid joins, the staff’s aura reacts, letting players know they’re “the chosen one.” <br>3. **Healing “Need” Check** – A simple Charisma (Medicine) or Wisdom (Insight) roll can determine if the staff will cast. Failure can lead to a narrative consequence (e.g., the staff’s voice is silent). <br>4. **Rest and Recovery** – The staff regains charges after a long rest. This encourages players to seek safe havens, making downtime part of the story. <br>5. **Side‑Effect Spells** – Use *Mass Cure Wounds* to heal an entire village, unlocking a village’s secrets or a new ally. | Using the rules in storytelling turns a stat sheet into plot points, making the item feel integral rather than an add‑on. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference: Staff of Healing (DMG/Player’s Guide)\n\n- **Attunement**: Bard, Cleric, Druid  \n- **Charges**: 7 (regains all after a long rest)  \n- **Spells** (1 charge each):  \n  - *Cure Wounds* (1st level)  \n  - *Heal* (3rd level)  \n  - *Mass Cure Wounds* (3rd level)  \n- **Special**: Can be used only on a creature you “feel the need to heal”; a DC check may be required if the target is hostile or otherwise reluctant.  \n\n---\n\n**Tip for the DM:**  \nWhen you want the staff to feel *alive*, give it a personality in the form of a faint, soothing voice that can whisper hints or warnings.

On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.\nd100                                              Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n01-05                                             You cast  slow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n06-10                                             You cast faerie fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n11-15                                             You are stunned until the start of your next turn,  believing something awesome just happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n16-20                                             You cast gust of wind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n21 - 25                                           You cast detect thoughts on the target you  chose.

The bonus is determined by the weapon’s rarity.\n\nWell of Many Worlds\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\nYou can use an action to unfold and place the well of many worlds\non a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once\nwell of many worlds\nhas opened a portal, it can’t do so again for 1d8 hours.\n\nWind Fan\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the\ngust of windspell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn’t be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a\ncumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.\n\nWinged Boots\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.  The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren’t in use.\n\nWings of Flying\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement) While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can’t use them again for 1d12 hours.\n"], "response": "**Wings of Flying – 5 e (DMG)**  \n*Wondrous item, uncommon (price 2 000 gp)*  \n\n> While wearing these wings, the creature gains a **flying speed of 30 ft**.  \n> The wings are part of the creature’s body, and they remain in place until the creature removes them (or the wings are destroyed).  The wings do **not** grant any special effect beyond the speed, nor do they allow the wearer to hover unless the creature can hover in normal flight.\n\n> *If the creature already has a fly speed, the creature uses the faster of the two speeds.*  \n> *If the creature’s walking speed is less than 30 ft, it still only gains a 30‑ft fly speed; it cannot fly faster than that.*  \n\n**Key points**\n\n| What you get | How it works | Caveats |\n|--------------|--------------|---------|\n| 30‑ft fly speed | As a regular speed, usable on your turn just like a walk or swim speed. | 1. It is a *fly* speed, not a *hover* speed; you must keep moving to stay airborne (unless you can hover via other means). 2. It does not grant resistance to falling damage. 3. The wings are part of your body; if you are missing a foot or cannot attach them, you can’t use them. |\n| No limits on uses | The speed is active as long as the wings are worn. | The item’s magic doesn’t “run out” during a combat. 4. The wings can’t be used by a creature that already has a fly speed, but you may keep the faster one. |\n| No other abilities | No spell‑casting, no extra effects. | If you have a flight spell (e.g., *fly*), you still need to cast it to gain that spell’s special features (like the *hover* trait). |\n\n**Flying speed in 5 e**\n\n- A *fly speed* is a type of speed listed in the character’s Speed table (PHB 190).  \n- You can use it for any movement, including moving up or down, as long as you’re not in a situation that specifically prohibits flying (e.g., “no flying in enclosed spaces”).  \n- If you have more than one type of speed, you use the one that best suits the situation.  \n- A fly speed that is lower than your walking speed can still be used; you simply choose the higher speed if you want to move faster.\n\n**What the Wings of Flying do NOT do**\n\n- They don’t give the *Hover* trait (unless the creature already has it).  \n- They don’t grant advantage on saving throws for falling, or immunity to falling damage.  \n- They don’t increase your carrying capacity or give you any other bonuses.\n\n---\n\n### If you’re playing 4 e (just in case)\n\nIn 4 e the item is called **Wings of Flying** and is a *magic item, uncommon*.  \n*It grants a fly speed of 10 ft for one use per day, which can be used as a move action.*  \nThe wings can be used a set number of times per day, and the speed is 10 ft, not 30 ft.  They also don’t grant hovering.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line**  \nIn 5 e, the Wings of Flying simply add a 30‑ft fly speed to whatever creature is wearing them.  Use it like any other speed, and remember it doesn’t give you hovering or any other special fly‑spell abilities.", "reference": "Wings of Flying is a rare wondrous item that requires attunement.

If you didn’t target a  creature, you become the target and must make  the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 o r  more, the target is instantly petrified. On any  other failed save, the target is restrained and  begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this  way, the target must repeat the saving throw at  the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a  failure or   ending the effect on a success. The  petrification lasts until the target is freed by the  greater restoration spell or similar magic.  \n\n\nWeapon, +1, +2, or +3\nWeapon (any), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)\nYou have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus is determined by the weapon’s rarity.\n\nWell of Many Worlds\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\nYou can use an action to unfold and place the well of many worlds\non a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once\nwell of many worlds\nhas opened a portal, it can’t do so again for 1d8 hours.\n\nWind Fan\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the\ngust of windspell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn’t be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a\ncumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.\n\nWinged Boots\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.  The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren’t in use.\n\nWings of Flying\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement) While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can’t use them again for 1d12 hours.\n"], "response": "## Wand of Binding  \n*(Home‑brew 5e magic item – rare, requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  \n\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Charges** | 3 (recharges at dawn) |\n| **Cost** | 1,500 gp (if found, 1,000 gp) |\n| **Weight** | 1 lb |\n| **Rarity** | Rare (requires attunement) |\n\n### Description  \nThis wand is a slender rod of polished black iron, studded with a single opal that glows faintly when a spell is cast from it. Its handle is wrapped in the hide of a captured wyvern, and the opal hums with a faint echo of the creature’s roars. The wand was forged by the legendary enchanter **Elyra the Chain‑Binder** in the age of the First Binding Wars, who used it to subdue the rogue spirits that threatened the kingdom of Thaloria.\n\n---\n\n### Mechanics\n\n**Casting a Binding Spell**\n\n*The wand is a spell‑casting focus for the following spells. When you cast one of them from the wand, you expend one charge.*\n\n| Spell | Level | Effect | Range | Duration |\n|-------|-------|--------|-------|----------|\n| **Hold Person** | 2nd | Paralyzes a humanoid | 30 ft. | 1 min. |\n| **Hold Monster** | 5th | Paralyzes any creature | 120 ft. | 1 min. |\n| **Polymorph** | 4th | Transforms a creature into a beast | 60 ft. | 1 hour |\n| **Banishment** | 4th | Sends a creature to another plane | 60 ft. | 1 round (or 1 day if the target fails a saving throw) |\n\n*You may also use the wand to cast the 6th‑level spell **True Polymorph** once per long rest (costs 2 charges).*\n\n**Binding to a Location**  \nWhen you expend a charge to cast **Hold Monster** or **Hold Person** on a creature that is not a construct, you may choose to bind that creature to the current location. If you do so, the creature can’t willingly move more than 5 ft. away from the point where the spell was cast, and any attempt to remove the binding requires a successful **DC 17** Strength (Athletics) check or a spell of *Dispel Magic* (or equivalent). This is a flavor effect; the mechanical duration remains 1 min.\n\n**Using the Last Charge**  \nWhen you cast a spell using the wand’s final charge (i.e., it goes from 1 to 0), roll a **d20**.  \n* 1–10: The spell succeeds normally, but the wand’s magic sputters, leaving a faint crack in the opal.  \n* 11–15: The spell fails, and the wand’s last charge is lost permanently.  \n* 16–20: The spell succeeds, **and** you gain a *temporary* boon: the next creature you bind with the wand (from the first charge of a new wand) is bound with a +2 bonus to the saving throw against your chosen spell. The wand, however, goes into a dormant state for 24 h (no charges can be used).  \n\nIf the caster is *not* attuned when the last charge is expended, the wand becomes inert for 1 d, then recharges normally at the next dawn.\n\n---\n\n### How to Bind Monsters or People\n\n1. **Target Selection** – Choose a creature you can see and is within the spell’s range.  \n2. **Spell Choice** – Use **Hold Monster** for any creature, or **Hold Person** for humanoids.  \n3. **Binding to a Site** – If you want the bound creature to stay near a particular spot, immediately declare the “binding to location” effect.  \n4. **Maintaining the Bind** – The binding lasts 1 min unless broken early by the target’s successful DC 17 Strength check or a *Dispel Magic* spell.  \n5. **Expanding the Effect** – If the wand is used on a creature that can’t be affected by *Hold Monster* (e.g., constructs), use *Polymorph* or *True Polymorph* instead.\n\n---\n\n### Risks of Using the Last Charge\n\n* **Uncertain Success** – The d20 roll can cause the spell to fail or the wand to become dormant.  \n* **Permanent Loss of the Wand** – If the roll is 11–15, the wand is ruined.  \n* **Potential for Unintended Consequences** – A *True Polymorph* cast from the last charge can have lingering effects if the target’s new form is hostile or uncontrolled.  \n* **Narrative Tension** – The final charge is a high‑stakes decision that can drive plot points (e.g., a last‑minute rescue or a sacrifice to bind a demon).\n\n---\n\n### Narrative Twists & Creative Uses\n\n| Twist | How the Wand Can Be Used | Narrative Hook |\n|-------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| **The Bind is a Trap** | The wizard who found the wand is actually a demon in disguise; each binding consumes a portion of the victim’s soul, giving the demon a foothold in the mortal plane. | PCs discover the demon’s plan when a recently bound ally begins acting oddly. |\n| **The Bound Creature Is an Ally** | A trusted NPC is captured by enemies; the PCs must use the wand to bind the enemy leader and then rescue the NPC, who can’t leave the location for 1 min. | Creates a tense rescue mission with a ticking clock. |\n| **The Wand’s Last Charge Can Bind a Plane** | Casting *True Polymorph* on a powerful dragon binds it to a pocket dimension for 1 day. | Gives the PCs a chance to negotiate or bargain with a dragon that is now “locked up.” |\n| **The Wand Requires Sacrifice** | The wand is cursed: every binding consumes part of the caster’s life force; using the last charge halves the caster’s hit points permanently. | Forces the PCs to weigh saving a friend versus protecting their own health. |\n| **The Wand Is a Decoy** | An adventurer uses the wand to bind a rival group, but the rival's leader uses *Dispel Magic* to free them, revealing that the rival is actually a cult trying to steal the wand. | Sparks a chase and confrontation with a hidden cult. |\n| **The Bound Creature Gains Power** | Each time the wand is used, the bound creature becomes harder to break out of its binding (the saving throw DC increases). | Creates escalating danger with each use, raising stakes. |\n| **The Wand’s Power Corrupts** | After the last charge is used, the wand glows brighter; a new, untested spell emerges (e.g., “Chain of Binding”) that allows the user to chain multiple creatures together. | Opens a new arc where the PCs must decide whether to use a powerful but potentially unstable spell. |\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Campaign Hook\n\nThe PCs recover the **Wand of Binding** from a ruined tower, but the final charge is locked in an ancient seal. The local mage suggests that the wand’s last charge can only be used if the caster **sacrifices** their own alignment—e.g., they must accept a *Chaotic* or *Evil* action to break the seal. The PCs can either:\n\n1. **Use the wand** to bind a looming threat (a summoned lich), risking the seal and the potential of the wand becoming inert.  \n2. **Attempt a ritual** (requiring a DM‑designed puzzle) to safely release the last charge.  \n3. **Seek out the wand’s creator’s diary** (Elyra’s notes), revealing a backstory that ties the wand to a forgotten covenant.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference for Game Masters\n\n- **Attunement:** Only one attuned character can use the wand at a time.  \n- **Charges:** 3, recharge at dawn.  \n- **Last Charge Roll:** d20 with three possible outcomes.  \n- **Binding to Location:** +5 ft. restriction, DC 17 Strength or *Dispel Magic*.  \n- **Narrative Tips:** Use the wand’s “dangerous last charge” as a climactic decision point; give the bound creature agency or a twist (e.g., the bound creature’s will changes the course of the spell).\n\nThis framework gives you a balanced magic item with enough lore, flavor, and flexibility to weave into any 5e story—whether the PCs are heroes, villains, or something in between.", "reference": "The Wand of Binding is a rare wand that requires attunement by a spellcaster.

The solar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n\nActions\nMultiattack. The solar makes two greatsword attacks.\nGreatsword. Melee Weapon Attack:\n+15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant damage.\nSlaying Longbow.Ranged Weapon Attack:\n+13 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant damage. If the target is a creature that has 100 hit points or fewer, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die.\nFlying Sword. The solar releases its greatsword to hover magically in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. If the solar can see the sword, the solar can mentally command it as a bonus action to fly up to 50 feet and either make one attack against a target or return to the solar’s hands. If the hovering sword is targeted by any effect, the solar is considered to be holding it. The hovering sword falls if the solar dies.\nHealing Touch (4/Day). The solar touches another creature. The target magically regains 40 (8d8 + 4) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.\n\nLegendary Actions\nThe solar can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The solar regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\nTeleport.The solar magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.\nSearing Burst (Costs 2 Actions).The solar emits magical, divine energy. Each creature of its choice in a 10--foot radius must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nBlinding Gaze (Costs 3 Actions).The solar targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see it, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving\nthrow or be blinded until magic such as the\nlesser restorationspell removes the blindness.\n\nAnimated Objects\n\nAnimated Armor\nMedium construct, unaligned\nArmor Class18 (natural armor)\nHit Points33 (6d8 + 6)\nSpeed25 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT     WIS     CHA     \n14 (+2)  11 (+0)  13 (+1)  1 (−5)  3 (−4)  1 (−5)  \n\nDamage Immunitiespoison, psychic\nCondition Immunitiesblinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned\nSenses blindsight 60 ft.

On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the\ngreater restorationspell or other magic.\nA creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk\nin the meantime, it must immediately make the save.\nIf the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.\n\nActions\nBite.Melee Weapon Attack:\n+5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSwallow. The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir’s turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.  If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.\n\nBugbear\nMedium humanoid (goblinoid), chaotic evil\nArmor Class 16 (hide armor, shield)\nHit Points 27 (5d8 + 5)\nSpeed 30 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT     WIS      CHA     \n15 (+2)  14 (+2)  13 (+1)  8 (−1)  11 (+0)  9 (−1)  \n\nSkillsStealth +6, Survival +2\nSensesdarkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10\nLanguagesCommon, Goblin\nChallenge1 (200 XP)\nBrute.

The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.\nWhenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can’t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.\nA duplicate has the cloaker’s AC and uses its saving throws.

The torso, arms, and face are that of a humanoid; the lower body is a full, powerful horse back. They stand tall (typically 10 ft on the ground, 5 ft tall when upright) and have a lean, athletic build. Their hair, ears, and facial features match the humanoid half, while their hooves, mane, and tail are equine. |\n| **Culture & Lore** | 1. **Greek roots** – Like the mythic centaurs, many D&D centaurs are portrayed as proud, warlike, or reclusive, living in forested or mountainous regions. 2. **Alignment** – In most settings they are **neutral or chaotic neutral**, though there are good‑aligned shepherd‑types and evil‑aligned war‑horses. 3. **Societies** – Some stories feature a **hierarchical tribe** (chief, shamans, hunters), while others present them as wild, unstructured herds. 4. **Playable** – They’re not an official 5e playable race, but many DM’s and home‑brew guides add them (often with the same stat blocks as the monster). |\n| **Stats (5e)** | **AC 12** (leather armor) | **HP 45** (6d10 + 12) | **Speed 40 ft** | **Str 18 (+4), Dex 12 (+1), Con 14 (+2), Int 8 (‑1), Wis 13 (+1), Cha 10 (0)** |\n| **Attacks** | • **Bite** – +6 to hit, 1d10 + 4 damage (piercing). <br>• **Hooves** – +6 to hit, 1d8 + 4 damage (bludgeoning). <br>• **Longbow** – +6 to hit, 1d8 + 4 damage (piercing).  <br>• **Pounce** (action) – If it moved 10 ft in the turn, it can make a melee attack; on a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength save or be knocked prone. |\n| **Key Traits** | • **Charge** – When the centaur moves at least 10 ft straight toward a target and hits with a melee attack, it gets advantage on that attack. <br>• **Pack Tactics** – (Only in 4e & earlier; omitted in 5e) it has advantage on an attack if an ally is within 5 ft. <br>• **Fast Movement** – 40 ft speed is a boon for hit‑and‑run tactics. |\n| **Typical Combat Style** | 1. **Ranged Initiation** – Stand on a hill or tree and fire a longbow at enemies, keeping out of melee reach. 2. **Herd Push** – When enemies close, charge to gain advantage and potentially knock foes prone. 3. **Melee Finish** – Use bite and hooves in a flurry; a two‑attack turn can deal up to ~26 damage (average). 4. **Mobility** – They can leap over obstacles, use terrain to their advantage, and are hard to pin down because of their speed. |\n| **Common Tactics in Encounters** | • **Positioning** – Keep enemies at distance to exploit longbow range. <br>• **Flanking** – If the party has a lot of enemies, a centaur may use *Pounce* on the one that can’t move out of the way. <br>• **Disrupt** – The bite is a good counter to spell‑casting creatures; a hit can break concentration. <br>• **Charge** – If a single target can be locked down, the centaur can use the *Charge* rule to gain advantage and possibly knock the target prone. |\n| **Notable In-Game Examples** | • **The Wild Beyond the Witchlight** – Centaurs of the *Witchlight Circus* serve as both allies and antagonists. <br>• **Tomb of Annihilation** – *Centaurs of the Jungle* are savage hunters. <br>• **Dragonlance** – The *Hawksong* tribe is a good‑aligned centaur nation. |\n| **Why They Matter** | 1. **Versatile NPCs** – They can be neutral allies, wise guides, or dangerous foes. 2. **Combat Depth** – Their combination of ranged and melee options forces PCs to plan spacing. 3. **Lore Rich** – Their Greek‑inspired backstory offers hooks for quests, morality dilemmas, or cultural festivals. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nA centaur is a tall, horse‑human hybrid that combines the agility of a horse with the intellect of a humanoid. They’re formidable foes (or allies) thanks to their strong melee attacks, deadly longbow skill, and natural speed. In combat, they often start with a long‑bow volley, then charge in for a bite or hooves, using *Pounce* to knock enemies prone. Their presence adds a mythic, “wild” flavor to any forest or hill‑top encounter.", "reference": "The Centaur is a Large monstrosity, neutral good, with AC 12 and 45 hit points.

Some older editions had a “Recharge 5‑6” limitation; in 5E it’s always available when you can see a target within 5 ft.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  The Basilisk’s Action Set\n\n| Action | Description | How It Plays Out |\n|--------|-------------|------------------|\n| **Petrifying Gaze** | The basilisk focuses its eyes on a creature it can see within 5 ft. | 1. The basilisk declares “I use my gaze.” <br>2. The target must make a **DC 13 Constitution saving throw**.<br>3. **Failure →** Target becomes *petrified* for 1 min. <br>4. **Success →** Target is **immune to this basilisk’s gaze for 24 h**.<br>5. While petrified, the target is *incapacitated, prone, and can’t move or speak* (the “petrified” condition).  <br>6. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can attempt the same Con save to end the effect early. |\n| **Bite** | Melee Weapon Attack (reach 5 ft.) | Attack bonus **+6** (to hit).  <br>Hit → **9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage**.  <br>Can be used on a target that’s within reach. |\n\n> **Important nuance:** The basilisk can use its gaze *only if it can see the target*. A blinded basilisk, or a target that’s invisible, is immune to the gaze (though the basilisk can still bite). Likewise, a creature that looks away at the start of the basilisk’s turn is safe from the gaze for that turn.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Petrifying Gaze – Step‑by‑Step\n\n1. **Turn Order:** The basilisk’s turn comes up.  \n2. **Choose an Action:** Pick “Petrifying Gaze” (it can’t bite and gaze at the same time).  \n3. **Select a Target:** Must be *within 5 ft.* and visible.  \n4. **Saving Throw:** Target rolls **Con +6** against **DC 13**.  \n   * If **success**, the basilisk’s gaze is **blocked** and the creature gets 24‑hour immunity.  \n   * If **failure**, the creature is **petrified** (instant incapacitated).  \n5. **Petrified Condition:** The target can’t move, speak, or take actions; it remains a statue for 1 min unless it saves again.  \n6. **Saving at End of Turn:** At the end of each of the petrified creature’s turns, it makes the same Con save. A success ends petrification early.\n\n> **Practical tip:** If you’re hit by the gaze, immediately cast *Dispel Magic* (or *Stone Shape* if you have it) on the statue or keep the statue in a safe spot while your party finishes the encounter.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Bite Attack – How It Plays Out\n\n- **Range**: 5 ft. (you must be in melee).\n- **Attack Bonus**: +6 to hit.\n- **Damage**: 1d10 + 4 piercing.\n- **Damage Resistances**: Non‑magical weapons do 1/2 damage. Use a **magic weapon** or a **spelled weapon** (e.g., *Magic Weapon* or *Flaming Sword*) to maximize damage.\n\n> **Tactical note:** A basilisk often uses its bite after the gaze if the target has moved away or if the basilisk cannot see the target for the gaze.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Reflection & “Mirrors” Quirk\n\n- In many D&D settings, basilisk eyes *do not reflect* in mirrors or polished surfaces. The basilisk’s gaze is a *direct visual effect*, not a reflection.  \n- **Implication:**  \n  * If you **look at a mirror** and the basilisk’s eyes appear as a blank/ghostly image, you are **not** the target of its gaze.  \n  * However, the basilisk still *sees you* (unless the mirror is behind an obstacle), so it can bite.  \n  * A reflective surface can be used to **draw the basilisk’s attention** away from you (if you stand in the reflected zone), but it is **not a foolproof trick**—the basilisk can still attack with its bite.\n\n> **Player trick:** In a narrow corridor, place a shiny object (mirror, polished metal, or even a wet stone) and have your character *direct the basilisk’s gaze toward the reflection*. The basilisk will focus on the reflection, sparing your character from the gaze (though it may still bite you when you get in reach).\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Tactical Considerations for Players\n\n| Situation | Recommendation |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| **Encounter begins** | Keep >5 ft. distance. Use ranged attacks or spells first. |\n| **Basilisk uses gaze** | If you *look away*, you’re safe. If you’re petrified, immediately cast *Dispel Magic* or *Stone Shape* (if you have it). |\n| **Basilisk’s bite** | Move out of reach. Use a **magic weapon** or *Magic Missile* to hit from distance. |\n| **Avoiding the gaze** | Use **darkness** (the basilisk has darkvision, so this only works if it’s blinded or you use *Blindness/Deafness* on it). |\n| **Reflective surfaces** | If you have a mirror or polished object, you can lure the basilisk’s gaze toward it. |\n| **Resistances** | Use **magical or silvered weapons** to bypass its non‑magical resistance. |\n| **Control** | Spells like *Hold Monster*, *Charm Monster*, or *Banishment* can keep the basilisk out of range entirely. |\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Quick Reference Cheat Sheet\n\n| Move | Action | DC | Effect |\n|------|--------|----|--------|\n| Petrifying Gaze | Action | 13 Con | Target is petrified (1 min). Success → 24 h immunity. |\n| Bite | Attack | +6 | 1d10 + 4 piercing (magic weapons ignore resistance). |\n| Reflective trick | None | — | Lure gaze toward reflection; still can bite. |\n| Dispel Magic | Reaction (if you have it) | — | End petrification or remove gaze if it’s still active. |\n\n---\n\n### 7.  Final Thoughts\n\n- The basilisk is a **classic “look‑ahead” hazard**.  The main danger is its gaze, which can instantly incapacitate a party member.  \n- **Combat success** depends on keeping distance, using magical or ranged attacks, and protecting a single target from the gaze.  \n- The **reflection quirk** is a fun flavor element but not a hard‑and‑fast mechanic.  Use it sparingly to keep the basilisk’s gaze off your party, but don’t rely on it for survival.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you’d like example encounter tables, how to incorporate a basilisk into a themed dungeon, or any other details!", "reference": "A Basilisk is a medium monstrosity that is unaligned. It has an Armor Class of 15, 52 hit points (8d8 + 16), and moves at 20 feet per round. Its ability scores are Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 8 (−1), Constitution 15 (+2), Intelligence 2 (−4), Wisdom 8 (−1), and Charisma 7 (−2). It has darkvision 60 feet and a passive Perception of 9, and it speaks no languages. The creature’s challenge rating is 3, worth 700 experience points. The Basilisk’s most notable feature is its Petrifying Gaze. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the Basilisk and both can see each other, the Basilisk may force that creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, provided the Basilisk is not incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained; it must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. A successful save ends the effect immediately. If the creature fails again, it becomes fully petrified until it is freed by a greater restoration spell or other magic. A creature that is not surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the initial saving throw; if it does so, it cannot see the Basilisk until the start of its next turn, at which point it may avert again. If it looks at the Basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw. The Basilisk also has a quirk: if it sees its own reflection within 30 feet in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze. In combat, the Basilisk can also bite. Its Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that requires a +5 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage on a hit.

Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it\nis carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\nWhile in mist form, the vampire can’t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can’t pass through water.

When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn’t in sunlight or running water. If it can’t transform, it is destroyed.  While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.\nRegeneration.

The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water. Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the vampire’s control, it takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire’s bite attack.\nEach time the vampire or the vampire’s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.\nChildren of the Night (1/Day).The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn’t up.

Sphinxes"], "response": "### Chaotic Evil Specter – Flavor Snapshot\n\n| Aspect | What it Looks Like & How It Acts |\n|--------|---------------------------------|\n| **Basic Identity** | A *specter* is an incorporeal remnant of a mortal who died with unfinished business. In its *chaotic evil* variant, it is not bound by any cause or pattern—its existence is a free‑wheeling, capricious force of destruction. |\n| **Appearance** | • A wavering, translucent figure, often shimmering in colors that shift like oil on water (gray‑black, bruised‑purple, or a sickly green). <br>• Eyes that burn with unblinking red or amber fire. <br>• Sometimes it manifests as a *fragmented* version of its former self: half‑grown child with a dripping skull, or a drunken man with a broken brass knuckle. <br>• It can ripple or split into dozens of swirling wisps, appearing simultaneously in many places. |\n| **Presence** | • The air grows cold, and a low, metallic hiss—like far‑off chains—follows its every movement. <br>• Its aura is “chaos”: sudden, disorienting echoes, shifting shadows, and the faint smell of ozone or wet stone. |\n| **Behavior** | • Unpredictable: may attack a lone traveler, then flee; may suddenly lurch into a crowded tavern, whispering madness into ears. <br>• It takes pleasure in causing confusion and discord—spreading rumors, making allies turn on each other, turning a battlefield into a chaotic maelstrom. <br>• It often resents order: it will sabotage a well‑organized funeral, tear up a charter of laws, or throw a town’s council into disarray. |\n| **Motivation** | • Pure malice for its own amusement, without a specific vendetta. <br>• It delights in *re‑creating* the chaos it experienced in life (perhaps it died fighting a battle, or was betrayed, and now wants the same in the after‑life). <br>• It may seek to drag living beings into its realm of disorder, feeding off the panic and fear. |\n| **Interactions** | • With **lawful** or **good** beings: it will try to break their resolve, sow doubt, and push them toward self‑sabotage. <br>• With **neutral** or **chaotic** characters: it may find a reluctant ally—one that shares its love for chaos—though it will betray them if it sees a more profitable target. |\n| **Powers & Abilities (Flavor‑wise)** | • *Haunting Presence*: the specter can flicker through walls, causing panic; it may momentarily turn a well‑trained fighter into a confused, disoriented version of himself. <br>• *Psychic Instability*: it can temporarily overwrite memories, inserting absurd, frightening scenes that leave victims screaming. <br>• *Riotous Touch*: a touch can set a room ablaze or turn a group of people into dancing, mind‑broken fools for a short time. |\n| **Typical Habitat** | • Abandoned temples, crumbling battlefields, and chaotic ruins. <br>• Often in places where the living are already in turmoil—towns at war, cities with civil unrest. |\n| **DM Tips** | • Let the specter have “incomplete memories” of its former life—random fragments that it attempts to piece together, often with the wrong context. <br>• Use it as a catalyst for unpredictable side‑quests: a party might be pulled into a riot, a dream‑like hallucination, or a cursed artifact that spreads discord. <br>• For combat: its unpredictability can be reflected in erratic attack patterns, random target switching, and environmental hazards. |\n| **Lore Notes** | • The *Monster Manual* (5e) lists specters as neutral, but its chaotic evil variant can be considered a “free‑spirited spirit” that refuses to be tamed. <br>• Older editions (3.x, 4e) also describe specters as revenants of the dead; a chaotic evil twist aligns with the *chaos* theme of those editions’ “Evil” specter variants (e.g., the “chaos specter” in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*). |\n| **Uncertainties** | • There is no canonical “chaotic evil specter” stat block in 5e; you would need to adjust the standard specter stat block (e.g., add chaotic traits, modify damage, add a “Searing Chaos” trait). <br>• How chaotic it gets can vary by DM—some treat it as a spontaneous, mindless hazard; others give it quasi‑sentient planning. |\n\n#### Quick “Flavor Snapshot” (for a DM’s notes)\n\n> *A specter roams the ruins of a shattered citadel, its translucent form flickering like a broken candle flame. Its eyes burn with a chaotic fire, and every step leaves a ripple of frost. It speaks in riddles that twist the minds of those who hear it, causing friends to turn on each other in a mad scramble. It stops only to watch the laughter of terror, then slips back into the mist to haunt the next victim. In its presence, order itself seems to decay, replaced by a wild, merciless anarchy.*\n\nUse this outline to paint a chaotic evil specter that feels like a living, breathing force of chaos—no rules, no loyalty, just raw, delicious mayhem.", "reference": "A chaotic evil specter is an incorporeal undead that can hover and fly 50 ft., move through objects, is harmed by sunlight, and uses a life‑draining melee spell attack that reduces a target’s hit‑point maximum.", "answer_relevancy": 0.7707571656664568, "semantic_similarity": 0.37234103321306367, "bleu_score": 0.0322783642152686, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.04218362282878412, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.022135416666666668, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.4473684210526316}

When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated.

Balors are the most feared of the demonic “Balor” class, appearing as towering, flaming‑red giants with horns, claws, and a massive scythe‑like weapon. |\n|---|---|\n| **Origin** | First appeared in the 3rd‑edition *Monster Manual* (later re‑printed in 4E, 5E). Balors are a subtype of *Demon* and belong to the *Fiend* hierarchy, ruling the plane of Avernus (the first layer of the Nine Hells in 4E) or the Blood War in 5E. |\n| **Appearance** | Height: ~25–30 ft.  Features: black skin, horns, flaming red eyes, wings, a long, fiery chain‑arm, and a great scythe or greatsword that can cleave. Their breath weapon emits a deadly fireball. |\n| **Role in the Game** | - *3E/4E*: One‑of‑a‑kind monster, usually a final encounter or a powerful boss. They are used in epic battles and demonic sieges. <br>- *5E*: Listed in the *Monster Manual* as a **2,200‑HP** creature (CR 19). They act as a classic boss or a major plot point. |\n| **Key Abilities** | - **Hellfire (breath weapon)**: 2d10 fire damage in a cone/line (save DC 18). <br>- **Balor’s Scythe**: melee weapon +10 to hit, 1d10+8 slashing + 2d8 fire, plus a chance to set the target ablaze (extra damage over 1‑2 rounds). <br>- **Rage (Enrage)**: In combat, a balor can become furious, gaining +2 bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and increased damage. <br>- **Supernatural Speed**: 60 ft. base speed, +20 on a single attack. <br>- **Invulnerability**: Resistance to fire, poison, psychic; immunity to necrotic, psychic, radiant. <br>- **Commanding Presence**: Charisma-based social or intimidation checks +2. |\n| **Stat Block (5E)** | **Armor Class** 21 (natural armor).  <br>**Hit Points** 240 (16d20 + 112).  <br>**Speed** 50 ft., fly 50 ft. (hover).  <br>**STR 24, DEX 12, CON 22, INT 16, WIS 14, CHA 18**.  <br>**Saving Throws** +12 Dex, +13 Con, +13 Wis.  <br>**Skills** Insight +10, Intimidate +11, Perception +10.  <br>**Damage Resistances** cold, lightning, necrotic, poison; bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from non‑magical weapons.  <br>**Damage Immunities** fire, psychic, radiant.  <br>**Condition Immunities** charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned.  <br>**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 20.  <br>**Languages** Common, Infernal.  <br>**Challenge** 19 (22,000 XP). |\n| **Typical Tactics** | 1. **Fly & Bombard**: Use *Hellfire* and the *Scythe* to whittle down the party. <br>2. **Enrage**: If a party member dies or is near death, the balor may rage to gain extra damage and attacks. <br>3. **Hit-and-Run**: With high speed, it can retreat to a distance, then use *Hellfire* again. |\n| **Lore Highlights** | - In 4E, Balors are described as “burning, half‑human, half‑demon giants” that command Avernus. They wield the *Breach of the Demonic* and are often allied with devils in the Blood War. <br>- In 5E, a Balor is an elder demon that is essentially a \"Hellfire Champion\" of the demonic hierarchy, often serving as a boss in campaigns set in the Abyss or in the “Blood War.” |\n| **How to Play a Balor** | *For PCs*: A player could take a Balor as an NPC (DMG, p. 313) or a playable *Demon* subclass in some 3E/4E home‑brew. <br>*For DMs*: Treat it as a major threat—use its speed, fire breath, and rage to make combat dramatic. Provide a narrative reason for its appearance (e.g., the party has summoned it, or it seeks vengeance). |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nA Balor is a legendary, towering demon that roars with fire. It’s a single, powerful boss used for climactic encounters, boasting high hit points, fire damage, and a devastating melee weapon.

Fly to Deepen a Campaign**\n\n| Hook | Lore & Setting Touch‑Points | Plot/World‑building Ideas | Narrative Payoff |\n|------|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| **Sky‑Guardian Myth** | Couatls are “ancient watchers” who keep the sky’s balance. Their ability to soar 90 ft. means they can patrol wide swaths of the air, spotting threats that ground‑bound foes can’t. | *The Sky‑Temple of Aeolis*: a ruined temple perched on a high plateau, guarded by a couatl that patrols the 90‑ft. altitude. The temple’s secrets are only reachable by riding the couatl—or by finding a way to match its speed. | Players must earn the couatl’s trust (through a moral test or a rescue) to access the temple’s knowledge, revealing a forgotten sky‑borne deity. |\n| **Wind‑Rider Culture** | Many societies live in floating cities or wind‑ship fleets. A couatl’s flight range sets the “air‑travel horizon”: a 90‑ft. speed translates into a natural limit for air‑ship navigation and wind‑current maps. | *The Kharan Wind‑Fleet*: airships use couatls as living sails. The fleet’s leader is a couatl that can “read” the winds and guide ships through the sky. A political crisis erupts when the couatl goes missing—players must hunt down the missing 90‑ft. guardian. | The couatl’s disappearance causes sky‑traffic chaos, exposing hidden sky‑pirates or an underground cult manipulating wind currents. |\n| **Aerial Puzzle** | Couatls’ flight isn’t just speed; it’s a *height* advantage. 90 ft. lets them access niches above most structures. | *The Hanging Vault of Thal*: a vault carved into a cliff face 120 ft. above the ground. The entrance is a 90‑ft. opening only reachable by a couatl or by a flying mount. A trapped couatl guards the vault; to open it, heroes must either help the couatl or create a platform that mimics its flight height. | By solving the height puzzle, players learn the vault’s origin—a secret library created by an ancient sky‑wizard, containing prophecies about the “sky‑wrought” order. |\n| **Messenger of the Divine** | Couatls are often used as divine emissaries. Their 90‑ft. flight allows them to traverse continents rapidly, delivering messages or warnings. | *The Prophecy of the Storm*: a couatl appears in a coastal town, dropping a scroll that foretells a storm that will rise from the sky. Because it can fly 90 ft., it can “drop” items onto cliffs, sea‑ships, or even through the open sky. Players track the couatl’s descent pattern to find the source of the storm. | The couatl’s path leads to an ancient sky‑temple where a forgotten deity’s wrath is being released—players must intervene before the entire region is submerged. |\n\n### Quick Tips for the DM\n\n1. **Highlight Altitude** – Use the 90‑ft. range to explain how couatls can “see” over entire cities or across plains, giving them a strategic advantage that players can witness (e.g., spotting enemies from afar).\n2. **Tie to Weather** – Couatls can sense atmospheric changes; their flight can be used to predict weather events or navigate wind‑swept terrain.\n3. **Cultural Reverence** – Many cultures might worship or fear a couatl because of its ability to glide between sky and earth, making it a symbol of divine favor or judgment.\n4. **Mobility as a Story Tool** – Use the couatl’s flight to move the party to remote locations, set the stage for “sky‑borne” encounters, or create chase scenes across rooftops and cloud‑spattered cliffs.\n\nBy weaving the couatl’s 90‑ft. flight into world lore, geography, culture, and plot hooks, a narrativeist can turn a single stat into a vibrant narrative thread that echoes throughout the campaign.", "reference": "The couatl’s fly speed is 90 feet, giving it aerial mobility that can be used to reposition, swoop, or traverse the sky.", "answer_relevancy": 0.9252120202898841, "semantic_similarity": 0.2819753707651438, "bleu_score": 0.0, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.046948356807511735, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.024350649350649352, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.6521739130434783}

Recharge 5‑6.  Great for flooding the battlefield or luring enemies into a puddle. |\n| **Acid Resistance** | Resistance to all acid damage.  Reduces the effect of its own breath, and gives it a natural shield in acidic environments. |\n| **Fire Vulnerability** | 50 % damage taken from fire attacks.  Makes fire‑based magic or a torch‑lit swamp a tactical liability for the dragon. |\n| **Legendary Actions** | Three per round: (1) **Tail Attack** (1d12 + Strength) – a sweeping blow that can knock foes prone; (2) **Wing Attack** (1d10 + Strength, +1d6 bludgeoning) – a blast of wind that can push enemies; (3) **Move** (30 ft).  These keep the dragon mobile and dangerous even when it takes damage. |\n| **Lair Actions** | In its swamp lair, the dragon can (1) **Summon Acidic Mist** (creates a 20‑ft‑radius fog of acid that damages and hampers vision), (2) **Create Black Water** (moves 30 ft of the swamp’s mud, turning it into slick, impeding movement), or (3) **Mold the Terrain** (turns a 10‑ft square into a pool of acid that requires a Dex save to avoid 4d6 acid).  These actions force PCs to adapt on the fly. |\n| **Spells** | Can cast spells like *detect magic*, *invisibility*, *hold person*, *fireball* (as a desperate last resort), and *fog cloud*.  The dragon’s spellcasting allows it to control the battlefield, target key PCs, or create ambushes. |\n| **Special Attack Powers** | Bite (2d10 + 4), Claw (2d6 + 4), and Tail (1d8 + 4).  All are strong, with the bite also dealing acid damage. |\n| **Swamp Adaptation** | Swims at 30 ft, moves through mud and thick vegetation without penalty, and can hide in the muck (advantage on Stealth checks). |\n| **Intimidating Presence** | Charisma 22, uses *Intimidate* (proficiency) to command minions or frighten foes. |\n\n---\n\n## Weaving These Traits into a Dramatic Encounter\n\n1. **Setting the Stage**  \n   - Place the fight in a *swamp lair*: low, drifting fog, bubbling mud, hidden pools.  \n   - The dragon’s lair can *summon acid mist* before the PCs even arrive, turning the swamp into a dangerous, slippery maze.  \n\n2. **First Contact – A Surprise Breath**  \n   - The PCs might be ambushed from behind a curtain of *black water* that the dragon creates with a lair action.  \n   - As they emerge, the dragon can unleash its **acid breath** from the shadows, forcing a split‑second Dex save.  \n   - The breath can also *acidify* a section of the swamp, turning a previously traversable path into a lethal acid trap.\n\n3. **Mobility vs. Terrain**  \n   - Use the dragon’s **legendary Wing Attack** to knock PCs off balance and then immediately use **Tail Attack** to finish the fall.  \n   - Follow this with a **Move** action to reposition, leaving a trail of *black water* that slows any pursuers.  \n   - PCs who try to use the swamp to their advantage must contend with the dragon’s **Meld into Swamp** ability, letting it slip through mud undetected.\n\n4. **Spell‑based Tactics**  \n   - If the PCs rely on a **fire‑based spell** or weapon, the dragon’s *fire vulnerability* turns that into a double‑edged sword—perhaps the spell inadvertently hurts the dragon after it lands in a puddle of acid.  \n   - The dragon might use *hold person* to root a single PC in place, then follow up with a **bite** that deals both piercing and acid damage, showcasing the synergy of its natural and magical attacks.\n\n5. **Lair Control**  \n   - Every round, the dragon can **create black water** to block escape routes, or **mold the terrain** into a new acid pool, forcing PCs to continually choose between fighting the dragon or saving themselves from the environment.  \n   - The lair’s **acidic mist** reduces visibility, encouraging desperate melee or long‑range tactics that risk running into the dragon’s breath.\n\n6. **Narrative Beats**  \n   - Let the dragon *speak* in a deep, echoing voice that reverberates through the mist, taunting PCs with cryptic threats (“Your fire will only make the water boil”).  \n   - Show the dragon’s *pride* by having it *command the local swamp monsters* (e.g., crocodiles, giant eels) to swarm the PCs when the dragon retreats to its lair.  \n   - End with the dragon’s **legendary actions** leaving a path of scorched, acid‑marred earth, a visual testament to its dominion, and perhaps a hint that it will return.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** A Black Dragon is a master of **acid** and **terrain manipulation**, a relentless aerial threat with powerful **legendary actions**, and a charismatic tyrant who uses its lair’s environment to its advantage. By staging the encounter in a swamp and constantly shifting the battlefield with breath, spells, and lair actions, a narrativeist can craft a tense, dynamic clash that tests the PCs’ combat acumen, tactical creativity, and resolve.", "reference": "A Black Dragon is a chaotic evil, amphibious dragon that can breathe air and water. It has acid breath (a line attack that deals acid damage), a Frightful Presence that forces creatures within 120 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened, and legendary resistance that allows it to succeed on a failed saving throw up to three times per day. In combat it can make a multiattack consisting of a bite, two claws, and a tail attack, each dealing piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage respectively. The dragon also has legendary actions: it can make a tail attack, a wing attack that deals bludgeoning damage and can knock creatures prone, or a Detect action that checks perception. Its resistances include acid immunity, and it has damage resistances to cold and to non‑silvered bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. A narrativeist could highlight the dragon’s acidic breath as a looming threat that scorches the battlefield, use its Frightful Presence to create tension among the party, and employ its legendary actions to keep the encounter dynamic and unpredictable. The dragon’s amphibious nature and ability to breathe both air and water can also be used to set the scene in a swamp or coastal setting, adding atmospheric depth to the encounter.", "answer_relevancy": 0.7716495061486005, "semantic_similarity": 0.38100180324933475, "bleu_score": 0.02000662307951836, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.14414414414414412, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.09148665819567979, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.33962264150943394}

They prefer swampy, marshy, or volcanic terrain. |\n| **Abilities** | • **Darkvision** 120 ft.  <br>• **Superior Strength** and **AC** that increase with age.  <br>• **Breath Weapon**: a cone of corrosive acid (or a line in earlier editions) that can destroy metal and stone.  <br>• **Intimidating Presence** (some editions include a special threat reaction). |\n| **Behavior** | • Highly territorial, guarding treasure and swampy lairs.  <br>• Prefer to attack from hiding places or via surprise.  <br>• Known to hoard gold and to be treacherous or sadistic. |\n| **Lair Actions** | In 5e, a black dragon can use **Lair Actions** each round to do things like:  <br>  *Create a cloud of sulfurous fumes.  <br>  *Force a creature to succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained.  <br>  *Summon a lesser creature or set a trap. |\n| **Common Roles in Campaigns** | • A powerful adversary for high‑level parties.  <br>• A villain’s lair or an ancient, forgotten ruin.  <br>• A plot point involving a cursed swamp or an undead dragon. |\n\n### If “Blak” is intentional\n- Some home‑brew settings or older sourcebooks (e.g., *Dragon Magazine* articles) have used alternate spellings like **“Blak”** to emphasize a particular regional variant or to avoid trademark issues.  These usually share the core traits of the black dragon but might have different lair environments (e.g., volcanic vs. swamp) or slightly altered breath weapon damage.\n\n### Quick Reference\n- **HP**: 240 (Adult), 385 (Ancient) – grows with age.  \n- **AC**: 19 (Adult), 21 (Ancient).  \n- **Speed**: 40 ft. flying, 20 ft. walking.  \n- **Damage**: Breath weapon 4d8 acid (cone).  \n- **Language**: Draconic.\n\n**Bottom line:** A “Blak Dragon” is almost certainly a black dragon – a malevolent, acid‑breathing chromatic dragon that thrives in dark, swampy or volcanic habitats and poses a formidable threat to any adventuring party. If you meant a specific variant or a different creature, let me know and I can refine the answer further.", "reference": "A Black Dragon is a chromatic dragon that is chaotic evil. It is amphibious, can breathe air and water, has acid immunity, and can use legendary actions such as Detect, Tail Attack, and Wing Attack.

For example, an Ancient Black Dragon is gargantuan with 367 hit points, AC 22, and can use an acid breath that deals 67 acid damage in a 90‑foot line. An Adult Black Dragon is huge with 195 hit points, AC 19, and its acid breath deals 54 acid damage in a 60‑foot line.

The pit‑fiend can cast multiple at‑will spells in a single round if it chooses, but each limited spell consumes one of the three uses.\n\n4. **Spellcasting Ability Score** – The high Charisma gives a DC 24 save, making it very difficult for most PCs to resist unless they have a very high Dex or a class feature that raises saves.\n\n---\n\n### Weaving the Spells Into a Narrative\n\n| Narrative Hook | How the Spell Helps |\n|----------------|--------------------|\n| **Ambush in a Cursed Vault** | *Darkness* shrouds the vault, rendering half the party blind. The pit‑fiend follows with *burning hands* to incinerate exposed gear, forcing the PCs to choose between a quick escape or fighting in the open. |\n| **Desperate Escape from a Falling City** | The pit‑fiend casts *fireball* to blast a canyon in the city walls, splitting the path into a perilous chasm that the PCs must navigate. The DC‑24 save tests their resolve. |\n| **Protection of a Sacred Relic** | The pit‑fiend uses *disintegrate* on the relic’s guardian (or on a PC who tries to steal it). The dramatic sound of a stone turning to dust raises the stakes and threatens the party’s mission. |\n| **Time‑Limited Threat** | The DM announces the pit‑fiend has only three *fireballs* remaining before it must retreat. Each use becomes a countdown; the PCs must decide whether to split their actions to finish it before the spells run out. |\n| **Emotional Stakes** | The pit‑fiend may cast *disintegrate* on an ally’s family heirloom or a key NPC, creating heartbreak that can either rally the PCs or drive them to desperation. |\n\n#### Tips for Heightening Tension\n\n1. **Use the DC** – A DC of 24 is almost impossible for most PCs; narrate the dread of a failed save (e.g., “The ground shudders beneath your feet as the inferno engulfs you, but something feels… off…”) to emphasize the threat.\n\n2. **Track Uses** – Keep a small tally on the table. When the pit‑fiend’s *fireball* or *disintegrate* count drops to one, the PCs can sense the final blow is near. This creates a palpable urgency.\n\n3. **Environmental Interaction** – The *burning hands* can ignite flammable objects, causing the room to collapse or a bridge to ignite. The *darkness* can hide a hidden trap or an ally that will reappear when the darkness fades.\n\n4. **Combine Spells** – The pit‑fiend might cast *darkness* to mask the *fireball*, so the PCs can’t see where the fireball will land. Or it might use *burning hands* to set a fire that expands into a *fireball*.\n\n5. **Narrative Foreshadowing** – Drop hints that the pit‑fiend can “tear the earth itself apart.” When it finally uses *disintegrate*, the PCs will realize the gravity of the situation.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n- **Charisma 24 → DC 24, +10 attack**  \n- **At‑Will:** *Burning Hands*, *Darkness*  \n- **3/day:** *Fireball*, *Disintegrate*  \n\nUse these spells to keep the PCs on edge, force them to make hard choices, and remind them that even a single *disintegrate* can turn a victory into tragedy.", "reference": "The Pit Fiend’s Innate Spellcasting uses Charisma as its spellcasting ability, giving it a spell save DC of 21.

They consider themselves the apex of draconic hierarchy and despise all other races, especially those who’ve ever crossed them.\n\n- **Mimicry of Fire**  \n  Their breath weapon is the purest form of fire: “the most devastating of all dragons.” This fuels their mythic reputation as the embodiment of destruction.\n\n- **Hoarding & Power**  \n  Red dragons hoard gold, jewels, and relics that “glow like embers.” They also covet power‑gaining items (e.g., +5 swords, magic weapons) and will go to great lengths to secure them.\n\n- **Rivalry**  \n  They see *silver dragons* as effete and *white dragons* as merely “winter snakes.” They respect *gold dragons* only to a degree; a gold dragon’s honor can sometimes be enough to provoke a confrontation.\n\n- **Legacy**  \n  In many campaigns, a red dragon’s “sire” (or “queen”) is a legendary entity tied to a particular mountain or kingdom, often referenced in ancient epics.\n\n---\n\n### Typical Settings\n\n1. **Volcanic Kingdom** – A mountain kingdom whose entire economy revolves around metallurgy, forged in the dragon’s breath. The dragon may sit atop the mountain as a tyrant, demanding tribute.\n2. **Ash‑Covered Desert** – A once‑luminous oasis now cursed by the dragon’s lingering fire. Travelers hear the echo of the dragon’s snarl over dunes.\n3. **Forgotten Cavern** – An underground network of tunnels where the dragon has cultivated a hidden civilization of slaves, dwarves, or even imprisoned dragons.\n\n---\n\n### Creative Ways to Incorporate a Red Dragon\n\n| Hook | Campaign Integration | Flavor Tips |\n|------|----------------------|-------------|\n| **The Dragon’s Tribute** | PCs are hired by a town to negotiate or eliminate the red dragon’s demand for “fire‑shards.” | Use a negotiation scene with a *charismatic* dragon that tries to bargain by offering a *miraculous* relic. |\n| **Dragon‑Cult** | A cult worships the dragon, believing it’s a deity of fire. The PCs must infiltrate or destroy the cult before the dragon’s “awakening.” | Give cultists “fire‑scar” tattoos, use incense that smells of sulfur. |\n| **Ancient Dragon’s Grief** | A red dragon has lost a beloved egg or a *Dragon’s Tear* (a rare gem). PCs must recover the treasure before the dragon’s rage turns the realm to ash. | Describe the dragon’s “sadness” as a slow, smoldering melancholy—its breath turns from fiery wrath to faint embers. |\n| **Dragon‑Infiltrated City** | A city has a hidden red dragon living beneath it, using its heat to power industry. The PCs discover the dragon’s secret, deciding whether to expose or ally with it. | Include steampunk/industrial elements: furnaces, railroads powered by the dragon’s breath. |\n| **Dragon as a Politician** | The red dragon masquerades as a ruler (e.g., “the Iron King”) to maintain a tyrannical regime. PCs are agents of rebellion. | The dragon speaks in grandiose, smoky prose. It manipulates the populace with fear of “burning the earth.” |\n| **Dragon‑Quest** | The PCs must retrieve a *Crown of Ember*, said to control a dragon’s mind. This leads to a series of trials inside a lava‑filled citadel. | Use puzzles that involve heat, reflection, and fire‑resistance. |\n| **Dragon’s Legacy** | The dragon’s ancient hoard contains a *Time‑worn Tome* that unlocks a forgotten *Forge of Ages*. PCs can forge a legendary weapon. | The tome’s pages glow red; the forge’s furnace never cools. |\n\n---\n\n### DM Tips for a Red Dragon Encounter\n\n- **Heat & Light** – Describe the world as if a low‑level sun is burning. Use visual cues (glowing magma pools, heat haze).\n- **Psychological Threat** – The dragon’s words can be used to instill terror or manipulate. Give it a “threat level” that escalates through intimidation, then intimidation → threat → force.\n- **Legendary Actions** – Plan for 3–4 turns of the dragon’s legendary actions in a 5‑minute window, ensuring the party must make tactical choices.\n- **Hoards & Rewards** – Include *unusual* items (e.g., a fire‑proof cloak, a “flame‑bound” weapon) to reward players. Let the dragon’s hoard be part of a larger narrative (a key to stopping a volcanic eruption, etc.).\n- **Reputation** – Prior encounters or rumors about the dragon can set the tone. If the dragon has already destroyed neighboring towns, the PCs feel the stakes.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**  \nA red dragon is the archetypal fire‑bringer, a force of nature that blends raw power with cunning pride. Place it in a fiery realm, let its breath echo through mountains, and allow its presence to influence politics, economics, and culture. By treating the dragon not only as a final boss but as a living entity with motives, you can weave a compelling narrative that keeps players on the edge of their seats.", "reference": "Red Dragon", "answer_relevancy": 0.6765180154592761, "semantic_similarity": 0.41947305124038603, "bleu_score": 0.011499571850032237, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.004750593824228029, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.002380952380952381, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 1.0}

Their hearts are warm and they prefer the company of good‑hearted folk rather than the isolation that other dragons seek. Known as “the first of the good dragons,” they are often seen as the guardians of civilization and are sometimes called “the silver‑clawed sentinels of the sun.” Their metallic scales shimmer like polished bronze, and they emit a faint, pleasant humming that resembles the call of a wind‑chime.  \nBronze dragons are naturally amphibious, living in coastal regions or near large bodies of water, and they often serve as protectors of coastal towns, ensuring the safety of ships and sailors. Their breath weapon—a swift bolt of lightning—reflects their affinity for the sea and the storm. They are wise, patient, and enjoy learning. Many bronze dragons are known to have apprentices and are generous in sharing their knowledge with the young of other races.  \n\nIn D&D lore, a bronze dragon is often a patron or ally to lawful‑good adventurers, especially those who value knowledge and cooperation.

Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action.

What are elementals?\n\n*Elementals* are primal beings that embody a single element or combination of elements.  They are not living in the normal sense; they are animated masses of the element’s pure power.  In the cosmology of most editions they hail from the Elemental Planes—distinct, planar realms that mirror the four classic elements.\n\n### Core traits (across editions)\n\n| Trait | 5 e | 3.5e/AD&D | 4e |\n|-------|-----|-----------|-----|\n| **Type** | Elemental | Elemental | Elemental |\n| **Alignment** | Usually Neutral (can be Evil or Good depending on type) | Mostly Neutral | Often Neutral |\n| **Size** | Varies: Small for Air, Medium for others | Varies | Varies |\n| **Senses** | Darkvision 60 ft, passive Perception 10 | Blindsight, Darkvision | Darkvision |\n| **Sustain** | *Sustaining Element* (spell, 1‑day) | *Elemental Spellcasting* | *Elemental Form* (energy resistance) |\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Representative Elemental Types (5 e)\n\n| Element | Typical stat block (5 e) | Common abilities |\n|---------|------------------------|------------------|\n| **Air Elemental** | Cha 16, AC 15, HP 67, Speed 20 ft, Fly 30 ft | *Gust* (bludgeoning), *Whirlwind* (concentration), *Dust Cloud* |\n| **Earth Elemental** | Cha 15, AC 15, HP 85, Speed 20 ft, climb 10 ft | *Stomp* (bludgeoning), *Quake* (earth‑shaking), *Rock Armor* (armor bonus) |\n| **Fire Elemental** | Cha 15, AC 13, HP 60, Speed 20 ft, Fly 20 ft | *Fireball* (bludgeoning/acid), *Flame Jet* (burn), *Incinerate* (fire damage) |\n| **Water Elemental** | Cha 15, AC 15, HP 76, Speed 20 ft, Swim 40 ft | *Water Jet* (bludgeoning), *Cold Burst* (cold), *Tidal Wave* (bludgeoning) |\n\n*Optional* elemental variants (e.g., **Ice**, **Lightning**, **Acid**) share similar stat blocks but swap damage types.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Creating & Summoning Elementals\n\n| Method | 5 e | 3.5e/AD&D | 4e |\n|--------|-----|-----------|-----|\n| **Sustaining Element** | Spell (6th‑level) that animates a 3‑by‑3‑by‑3 cube of the element; lasts 1 day or until caster’s concentration ends | *Elemental Creation* spell, or a *Sustaining Element* ritual | *Elemental Invocation* |\n| **Summon Elemental** | 4th‑level *Summon Elemental* spell (creates a single elemental of chosen type) | *Summon Monster* 4‑th or *Summon Elemental* | *Summon Elemental* (spell level depends on elemental) |\n| **Elemental Storm** | *Elemental Swarm* (3rd‑level, creates swarm of elementals) | *Elemental Swarm* | *Elemental Swarm* |\n| **Ritual** | *Ritual of the Elemental* (rare, DM’s discretion) | *Ritual of Elemental Control* | *Ritual of the Elemental* |\n\n**Key Points**\n\n- **Concentration**: Most summoning spells require concentration. Losing it ends the elemental’s existence (unless sustained by *Sustaining Element*).\n- **Duration**: Summoned elementals typically last up to 1 hour per caster level (or until dispelled/defeated).\n- **Control**: Summoned elementals obey the caster’s verbal commands for the spell’s duration, but they can act independently if the caster loses concentration.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  In Combat\n\n1. **Damage Vulnerabilities/Resistances**  \n   - *Earth* – Vulnerable to Fire, Resistant to Acid  \n   - *Fire* – Vulnerable to Cold, Resistant to Lightning  \n   - *Air* – Vulnerable to Lightning, Resistant to Cold  \n   - *Water* – Vulnerable to Acid, Resistant to Fire  \n\n2. **Condition Immunities**  \n   - Most elementals are immune to *blinded, deafened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, stunned* and *exhaustion* (see stat block).  \n\n3. **Special Abilities**  \n   - Many can *burst* (create an area effect), *sustain* (regenerate), or *meld* (merge with the environment).  \n   - *Elemental Surge* (4e) allows a surge of power for a single attack.  \n\n4. **Strategy**  \n   - Use their *vulnerabilities* to defeat them quickly.  \n   - Elementals usually have low Strength but high Constitution; they are hard-hitting but can be outranged.  \n   - When fighting a *Living Elemental*, be mindful that they are *living* and may not be immune to poison, exhaustion, or other effects that affect living creatures.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Lore\n\n- **Elemental Planes**: Each plane mirrors its element, populated by its native elementals, elemental cults, and elemental lords.  \n- **The Elemental Chaos**: In many settings, all four elemental planes are connected by a swirling \"chaos\" where elemental beings mix and war.  \n- **Elemental Lords**: Powerful entities (e.g., *Bahamut* is a *Fire* elemental in some lore, *Rillifane Rallathil* is *Earth* elemental in others).  \n- **Elemental Creatures**: Some classes and races are tied to elementals: *Elementalists*, *Sphinxes*, *Naga*, *Golem* constructs (which emulate elementals).\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Quick Reference (5 e)\n\n| Element | Damage Type | Common Weakness | Common Strength |\n|---------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Air | Bludgeoning, thunder | Fire | Lightning |\n| Earth | Bludgeoning, acid | Fire | Acid |\n| Fire | Fire, bludgeoning | Cold | Fire |\n| Water | Cold, bludgeoning | Acid | Fire |\n| Ice | Cold | Fire | Acid |\n| Lightning | Lightning | Acid | Lightning |\n\n---\n\n### Uncertainties & Variations\n\n- **Exact stat blocks** vary between published supplements and campaign settings; use the *Monster Manual* or *Elemental Guide* as your baseline.  \n- **Elemental Alignment** can differ: some editions treat *Air* and *Water* as *Chaotic*, others as *Neutral*.  \n- **Rituals** such as *Ritual of the Elemental* are house‑rule options; DM approval is advised.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need specific spell descriptions, a particular edition’s stat block, or advice on how to incorporate elementals into your campaign!", "reference": "Elementals are large elemental creatures that are neutral in alignment.

Using Legendary Resistance does not alter any of those. It only changes the outcome of the particular saving throw that was failed. |\n\n---\n\n## Step‑by‑Step Example\n\n1. **The dragon’s turn**  \n   - A wizard casts *fireball* at the dragon.  \n   - The dragon must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15).\n\n2. **The roll**  \n   - The dragon rolls 7 on a d20 → total 7 (fails the save).\n\n3. **Trigger**  \n   - The dragon’s Legendary Resistance is immediately triggered because it just failed a save.  \n   - The DM asks the dragon’s player: “Do you use Legendary Resistance?”  \n   - The player says yes. (No action cost.)\n\n4. **Outcome**  \n   - The dragon automatically succeeds on the Dexterity save, no damage from the *fireball*.  \n   - The dragon’s 3rd Legendary Resistance use is now reduced to 2 for that day.\n\n5. **Continuing combat**  \n   - After the *fireball* round ends, the dragon can still:\n     - Use its regular actions (attack, move, etc.).\n     - Use one of its legendary actions at the end of another creature’s turn (if it still has any legendary actions left).\n     - Take any reactions that might trigger later.\n\n---\n\n### What If the Dragon Doesn’t Use Legendary Resistance?\n\n- The save remains failed; the dragon takes full damage or suffers whatever effect the spell or attack imposed.\n- The Legendary Resistance use is *not* consumed, so the dragon still has 3 uses available for later failures.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **3 uses/day.**  \n- **Instantly resolves a failed save** (no action cost).  \n- **Does not affect the dragon’s other actions**; it merely negates the specific failure.  \n- Once all 3 uses are spent, the dragon must rely on its normal saving throws for the rest of the encounter.", "reference": "The silver dragon has Legendary Resistance (3/Day).

The Gigan regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\n\n| Action | Cost | Effect |\n|--------|------|--------|\n| **Detect.** The Gigan makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. |\n| **Claw.** The Gigan makes one claw attack. |\n| **Move.** The Gigan moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. |\n\n---\n\n## How to Use This Monster\n\n1. **Scaling** – Adjust the hit points or damage by ±1–2 d12s if you want to make it easier or harder for a particular party.  \n2. **Encounter Placement** – Place it near a body of water or a frozen cavern to use its *Ice Form* trait.  \n3. **Environmental Interaction** – Give it a *frozen* terrain feature that grants it temporary hit points or a *freezing wind* that gives it advantage on its attacks.  \n4. **Flavor** – Give it a simple motive: guard a hidden crystal, patrol the borders of an ancient glacier, or simply wander the cold wastes.  \n\n---\n\n### Uncertainty Note\nThere is no published entry for a “Frost Gigan” in any official D&D 5e material. The stat block above is a home‑brew design created by applying the standard *Giant* template (as seen in the Monster Manual) with added cold‑themed traits.

(No special “shove” or “sweep” trait in the 5e stat block.) |\n| **Actions** | **Multiattack.** The giant makes two attacks: one with its greataxe and one with a thrown rock.<br>**Greataxe.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d12 + 6) slashing damage.<br>**Rock.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. |\n| **Lair Actions** *(optional, if used)* | None in the core Monster Manual (but some sourcebooks give “cold burst” lair actions). |\n| **Legendary Actions** | None. |\n\n---\n\n## Quick Lore for the Novice Adventurer\n\n* **Where They Live** – Frost giants are found in the harsh, icy reaches of the north: frozen tundras, mountain peaks, and deep underground caverns where the air is thin and the temperature is sub‑zero. They build their fortresses in the snow, with massive stone walls and huge, reinforced doorways to keep out the chill (and the unwelcome guests).  \n* **Typical Behavior** – They are **chaotic evil** by nature, driven by a primal lust for power and domination. They are proud, belligerent, and will attack anything that threatens their claim to a piece of the frozen landscape, especially other giants.  \n* **Weaknesses** – The giant’s cold resistance means that fire‑based attacks are more effective than normal physical blows. Their huge size makes them slow; a clever party can use speed, terrain, and a bit of surprise to keep a Frost Giant off‑balance.  \n* **Typical Equipment** – A greataxe is almost always at hand, and they often carry a large rock or a stone “spear” that can be thrown with deadly force. Some frost giants also use enchanted weapons or carry large, heavy shields—though the basic stat block assumes a simple greataxe.  \n* **Why They Matter** – In classic adventure modules, a Frost Giant can be the leader of a local tribe, a boss in an ice‑cavern dungeon, or a gatekeeper to a powerful artifact hidden deep within a glacier. Their presence signals that the party is in a place where the environment itself is as dangerous as the creature.\n\n---\n\n### Tactical Tips\n\n1. **Avoid Cold Damage** – Fire or acid weapons (or a good *burning hands* from a spellcaster) are great.  \n2. **Use the Environment** – The giant’s slow movement (40 ft. per round) can be mitigated by falling cliffs, slick ice, or tight corridors that force the giant to navigate carefully.  \n3. **Hit & Run** – Focus on the greataxe for the most damage, but keep a ranged attack (the rock) as a backup if the giant gets surrounded.  \n4. **Target the Giant’s Weak Spot** – The *Greataxe* attack can also shove, so a successful *Athletics* check may push the giant into a trap or into a precarious terrain feature.  \n5. **Plan for the Rock** – The 60/240 ft. range means the giant can strike from afar; keep the party spread and use cover.\n\nWith this overview, you should be able to understand the Frost Giant’s raw power, predict its actions in combat, and appreciate its role in the icy wilderness that adventurers often explore.

Its key ability scores are Strength 23 (+6), Dexterity 9 (−1), Constitution 21 (+5), Intelligence 9 (−1), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 12 (+1). The saving throws it makes are Constitution +8, Wisdom +3, and Charisma +4. It has a skill of Athletics +9 and Perception +3. The giant is immune to cold damage. Its passive perception is 13, and it speaks the Giant language. The challenge rating of a Frost Giant is 8, which corresponds to 3,900 experience points. In combat, the Frost Giant uses a multiattack that allows it to make two greataxe attacks. Each greataxe attack is a melee weapon attack that requires a +9 to hit, has a reach of 10 feet, and deals 25 damage (3d12 + 6) slashing damage. The giant also has a rock attack, which is a ranged weapon attack that requires a +9 to hit, has a range of 60/240 feet, and deals 28 damage (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

The hag can breathe air and water.\nHorrific Appearance. Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag’s true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect\non itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag’s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\nUnless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag’s true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw.

The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\n\nHalf-Dragon Template\nA beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon.

The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.\nWhile charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.\nA target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy’s song for the next 24 hours.\n\nHell Hound\nMedium fiend, lawful evil\nArmor Class15 (natural armor)\nHit Points45 (7d8 + 14)\nSpeed 50 ft.\nSTR      DEX      CON      INT     WIS      CHA     \n17 (+3)  12 (+1)  14 (+2)  6 (−2)  13 (+1)  6 (−2)  \n\nSkills Perception +5\nDamage Immunities fire\nSenses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15\nLanguages understands Infernal but can’t speak it\nChallenge 3 (700 XP)\nKeen Hearing and Smell.

Below is a quick‑reference overview that covers lore, typical traits, and the most common variants you’ll find in 5th‑edition (5e) games, with brief notes on earlier editions.\n\n| Item | 5e Standard Kobold | 3.5/4e & Common Variants |\n|------|--------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Size** | Small | Small |\n| **Speed** | 30 ft. | 30 ft. |\n| **Alignment** | Usually lawful or neutral (often lawful‑evil in many modules). | Generally lawful, with some “lawful‑evil” subraces in 3.5. |\n| **Languages** | Common, Draconic | Common, Draconic (and variant‑specific). |\n| **Ability Scores** | +2 Dexterity, +1 Constitution | Same as 5e, with some 3.5 variants gaining +1 Strength. |\n| **Traits** | • **Darkvision** 60 ft.  <br>• **Dwarven Resilience** – advantage on saves vs poison and resistance to poison damage.  <br>• **Pack Tactics** – advantage on attack rolls if an ally is within 5 ft.  <br>• **Tinker** – proficiency with tinkering tools.  <br>• **Kobold Tactics** – you can use a bonus action to drop a simple trap; any creature within 30 ft. must make a DC 15 Wisdom save or be restrained for 1 round. | • **Kobold Tactics** – 3.5/4e use “Kobold Tactics” (similar to above).  <br>• **Kobold Tactics (3.5)** – ability to set a trap as a free action. |\n| **Equipment** | Shortsword or dagger; shield (optional). | Same as 5e. |\n| **Sub‑races (5e)** | • **Standard**  <br>• **Fire** – Resistance to fire damage, +1 Strength.  <br>• **Desert** – Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in desert, +1 Constitution.  <br>• **Swamp** – Advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks in swamp, +1 Dexterity. | • **Stone** (3.5) – +1 Strength, +1 Constitution. <br>• **Drow Kobold** (4e) – +1 Dexterity, +1 Charisma. |\n| **Common Roles** | Trap‑makers, scouts, laborers, and occasionally, simple warriors. | Same; 3.5/4e modules sometimes use kobolds as “kobold warriors” or “kobold miners.” |\n\n### Quick Lore Snapshot\n\n- **Origins**: Kobolds trace their ancestry to small dragons. Their societies are tightly knit, often built around a local dragon or a clan of elder kobolds who claim draconic descent.\n- **Society**: Structured around a hierarchy of “tribes” or “clans,” each led by a chief or elder. They are renowned for their ingenious use of traps and clever, low‑power weapons. In many settings, they work as miners, engineers, or mercenaries for more powerful allies.\n- **Culture**: Kobolds value cleverness over brute strength. They respect craft, especially in trap‑making and smithing. They’re often suspicious of outsiders but will cooperate if it benefits the clan.\n- **Typical Encounters**: Players may find kobolds in mine tunnels, caves, or deep in the Underdark. They often swarm in large numbers, use hit‑and‑run tactics, and set elaborate traps to offset their physical weakness.\n\n### Key 5e Features to Note\n\n- **Kobold Tactics** (bonus action trap placement) is one of the defining mechanics; it makes kobolds deadly in groups.\n- **Pack Tactics** encourages group play and is a strong justification for kobolds to swarm foes.\n- **Tinker** gives them a natural skill with tinkering tools, which can be flavored as “trap‑making” or “clockwork crafting.”\n\n### Variants in Other Editions\n\n- **3.5**: The *Kobold* race (Player’s Handbook II) had similar traits but added “Kobold Tactics” as a free action. *Kobold* can also be a subrace of the *Dragonkin* class in *Draconomicon*.\n- **4e**: Kobolds appeared as a playable race in *Monster Manual II* with similar pack tactics and trap abilities; they also served as the “Kobold” class in *Monster Manual II* (a “Warrior” with a focus on traps and trapsmithing).\n- **Early Editions**: In AD&D 1st/2nd edition, kobolds were typically presented as “small dragon‑folk” with limited abilities; they were often used as “trap‑miners” in dungeons.\n\n### Quick Checklist for Game Masters\n\n1. **Size & Speed** – 30 ft. Small creatures are harder to hit but can slip into tight spaces.\n2. **Armor** – Typically leather or scale mail; can use shields.\n3. **Tactics** – Use traps first; hit and run; swarm.\n4. **Social Interaction** – Often distrustful; reward loyalty or bribes.\n5. **Traps** – Design simple mechanical traps (tripwires, pit‑traps, snares). Use the **Kobold Tactics** rule to give them an extra edge.\n6. **Scale** – In large groups, kobolds can overwhelm even competent fighters.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** Kobolds are a staple of D&D lore, providing a flavorful mix of trap‑craft, pack tactics, and dragon‑inspired mystique. Whether you’re playing them as NPCs or creating a kobold‑themed adventure, their small size, cunning, and knack for traps make them a fun, memorable challenge for players.", "reference": "Kobold is a small humanoid (kobold), lawful evil.

{"user_input": "What are Monsters (H) Hags?", "reference_contexts": ["Monsters (H) Hags"], "response": "**Hags** are a distinct type of fey monster in Dungeons & Dragons, usually portrayed as crone‑like, malevolent beings who thrive on trickery, curses, and the manipulation of other creatures.  In most editions they are “high‑level” threats (typically 8–14 HD in 5e) that can haunt a region, form covens, and spawn a variety of minions (goblin‑like “hagcats”, “swan‑spawn” etc.).  \n\n| Edition | Typical Role | Key Traits | Example Subtypes |\n|---------|--------------|------------|------------------|\n| **5e** | Powerful, solitary or coven‑based villains; excellent “dark” NPCs. | Fey, often with a mix of spellcasting and innate magical abilities; strong deception, mind‑control, and curse‑casting. | **White Hag** (cold‑frost, mind‑shards), **Brown Hag** (earth, curses, animal companions), **Green Hag** (poison, plant‑based magic, shape‑changing). |\n| **3.5/4e** | Legendary/epic adversaries; often used in end‑game modules. | Similar to 5e, but with more diverse spell lists and sometimes a “hag spirit” that can appear in a coven. | Same three subtypes plus the “Hag Queen” (a powerful elder). |\n| **Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes / other sourcebooks** | Expanded lore; sometimes used to explain different hag lineages and their relations to the Feywild. | Introduces “night hags”, “sea hags”, etc., with unique environments and motivations. |\n\n### Core Characteristics\n\n1. **Fey Nature** – Hags are fey, which gives them resistance to magic (especially illusion) and a tendency toward chaotic, capricious behavior.\n2. **Coven Structure** – They often work in groups of three (a classic “coven”), gaining bonuses when together (e.g., shared spell slots, mutual healing).\n3. **Curses & Tricks** – Their magic revolves around curses (e.g., *bane*, *feeblemind*), mind‑control (e.g., *hold person*, *dominate monster*), and deceit (e.g., *detect thoughts*, *phantasmal killer*).\n4. **Physical Traits** – Their bodies are gaunt, with tattered clothes, and they often have a natural “crone” appearance. Their bite is a spell‑casting ability, and they often have a poisonous or corrosive touch.\n5. **Environment** – Each subtype favors a particular environment: \n   * White Hags: icy, mountainous terrain; \n   * Brown Hags: swamps/forests; \n   * Green Hags: swamps/undergrowth and often accompany “hagcats” and “swan‑spawn”.\n\n### Sample Stat Snapshot (5e)\n\n| Ability | Value |\n|---------|-------|\n| AC | 16 (mage armor, natural armor) |\n| HP | 82 (10d8 + 40) |\n| Speed | 30 ft. |\n| Saves | Dex +7, Con +8, Wis +7 |\n| Attacks | Bite +9 (2d6+5) |\n| Spells | 3/ day: *bane*, *sleep*, *feeblemind*, *hold person*, *cone of cold* (White) |\n\n(Each subtype has a distinct spell list; Brown Hags favor *barkskin* and *plant growth*, Green Hags use *poison spray* and *entangle*.)\n\n### Role‑playing Hags\n\n- **Evil, cunning**: Hags often bargain, trick, or threaten.\n- **Longevity**: They can live for centuries; their knowledge of the Feywild can be invaluable or dangerous.\n- **Cultural impact**: Local folklore may view them as “crone” legends—witches, witch‑craft, or “fey tricksters.”\n\n### Encounter Tips\n\n- **Avoid the coven**: Taking down one hag may weaken the others.\n- **Use the environment**: Ice or swamp hazards can amplify a hag’s power or give the party an advantage.\n- **Neutralize curses**: Dispel magic or remove cursed items before they spread the hag’s influence.\n\n---\n\nIn short, **Monsters (H) Hags** are a specific type of fey monster in D&D—wise, cruel, and adept at curses—present in most editions in three main subtypes (White, Brown, Green).

The hag can breathe air and water. Innate Spellcasting. The hag’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery Mimicry. The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check. Actions Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage. Illusory Appearance. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised. Invisible Passage.The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her."], "response": "### Green Hag’s “Invisibility” – what it actually means\n\nIn the *Monster Manual* (5e) the green hag has a *spell‑casting* feature:\n\n> **Invisibility**. The hag can cast the spell *invisibility* on herself.  \n\nIt is *not* a passive “invisible‑passage” or “hide in plain sight” ability; it’s simply the hag’s own use of the 2nd‑level spell *invisibility*.\n\n| Feature | What it does | How long | How it can be broken | Equipment & tracking |\n|---------|--------------|----------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| **Invisibility spell** | Target (the hag) and anything she is wearing or carrying becomes unseen by normal sight. | 1 hour (spell’s duration) or until she ends it. | 1. **Dispel Magic** (any creature with the spell can end it). 2. **Counterspell** (if the hag is just casting it, not while it’s active). 3. Spells that *see* invisible creatures (e.g., *True Seeing*, *Detect Magic* + *See Invisibility*). 4. Certain class features (e.g., a rogue’s *Unseen Servant* is unaffected, but a fighter’s *Unseen Attack* can still hit an invisible target). | • **Equipment**: Anything she is wearing or carrying also becomes invisible, so a visual inspection can’t reveal it.  • **Tracking**: Invisibility only removes visual detection.  The hag can still be found by:  <ul> <li>Sound – footsteps, whispers, or any noise she makes.  <li>Smell – her scent, especially if she’s nearby.  <li>Footprints – on soil or other surfaces, unless she’s been careful.  <li>Tracking spells – *Find the Path*, *Locate Creature*, *Scent* (the hag’s scent is “unusual” if the monster is the target).  <li>Other sensory tricks – a *Detect Evil and Good* or *Detect Magic* check will tell you an invisible creature is present, but not its location.  <li>Physical effects that force a visual confirmation – e.g., a *Wall of Thorns* or a *Blade Barrier* that touches her will reveal she’s there.  </ul> |\n\n### Practical limits\n\n* **Duration** – Always the spell’s normal 1‑hour length.  A hag can “toggle” the spell (casting it again if it’s ended) as a 5‑minute action or use it as a spell‑slot.\n* **Detection** – You cannot see the hag, but you can still sense her presence through other senses.  A creature with *True Seeing* can see her, and any spell that “reveals” invisible creatures can break the effect.  Dispel Magic will simply end the spell outright.\n* **Equipment** – The hag’s gear, weapons, and any items she’s carrying become invisible too.  This means she can leave a hidden stash and walk around it unseen.\n* **Tracking** – Visual tracking (searching for footprints, following a trail of footprints, etc.) works exactly as it would with any creature.  Sound, scent, and the use of tracking spells remain useful.  The hag can try to mitigate this by moving silently, staying in a scented environment, or by using a *Hide* spell to conceal herself from those who rely on sight.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nThe green hag’s “invisible passage” is really the 2nd‑level *invisibility* spell cast on herself.  It lasts for an hour, can be dispelled or otherwise broken by spells that see invisible creatures or by *Dispel Magic*, and it makes all of her equipment invisible as well.  But it does **not** magically conceal her tracks or her noises – she’s still detectable by sound, smell, footprints, and any tracking magic that doesn’t rely on vision.", "reference": "The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).

They value balance between land and sea, trade, and protection of marine life.  \n   - **Common Traits**:  \n     * Amphibious – can breathe air and water.  \n     * Aquatic – can see underwater and under normal sea conditions.  \n     * Darkvision – 60 ft. (useful for night or caves).  \n   - **Typical Behavior**: They are curious about surface dwellers, often guarding reefs, and sometimes become merchants or mercenaries.  \n\n5. **Encounter Design**  \n   - **Solo**: A lone merfolk may act as a guard or scout.  \n   - **Group**: 2–3 for a small patrol; 4–5 for a larger force.  \n   - **Boss**: Upgrade stats (e.g., +2 to AC, 35 HP, add a *trident* spell‑casting option) but keep the CR around 2–3.  \n\n6. **Sanity Check on CR**  \n   - **Damage per round** (average): Bite (5) + Tail (7) + Trident (8) ≈ 20 DPR.  \n   - **Defense** (AC 12) is moderate; a 12‑to‑hit with a 5 DPR average is roughly **CR ½** per DMG guidelines.  \n   - **HP** (27) and AC 12 align with CR ½ expectations.  \n   - Adding the spellcasting (one 1st‑level spell per round) increases DPR by ~2–3, still within the CR ½ range.  \n   Therefore, the listed stats are consistent with a ½ challenge rating. If you want to bump the CR, increase HP, AC, or damage (e.g., add a *trident* that deals 1d10 instead of 1d8), but keep in mind that the overall encounter balance should stay within the DMG tables for 5e.\n\n### Quick Tips for Playing Merfolk\n\n- **Use the water environment** to your advantage: underwater combat rules, swim speed, and limited visibility.  \n- **Spellcasting**: Treat *Merfolk Magic* as a 1/day resource; allow the DM to decide which spell they use based on the situation.  \n- **Interaction**: Give them a unique culture—perhaps they can trade pearls, speak in riddles, or offer quests involving lost shipwrecks.  \n- **Flavor**: Emphasize their song-like voices and graceful movements; describe their eyes reflecting the deep sea.\n\n**Bottom line:** Pull the stat block, decide the role (enemy, ally, or PC), use the listed actions and magic, sprinkle in the lore, and verify that the CR stays in line with the damage and defenses. That’s all you need to have a functional and balanced Merfolk (Merfok) in your D&D game.

Quick Lore Reference\n\n- **Origin:** Weretigers are one of the classic lycanthropes in the 5e multiverse, often found in forests, swamps, and jungles.  \n- **Behavior:** They are feral, instinct‑driven hunters that value strength and stealth.  \n- **Culture:** Some weretigers are “controlled” by powerful sorcerers or druidic circles; others roam free.  \n- **Threat level:** In the Monster Manual, the weretiger is a **CR 5** creature, making it a solid mid‑level encounter for a small party.\n\n---\n\n### Step‑by‑Step “Use It” Example\n\n1. **Turn 1** – You’re in humanoid form, have a longsword.  \n2. **Action:** You choose to transform into the tiger.  \n   - You keep the longsword, but it’s now unusable (tiger can’t wield it).  \n   - Your hit points stay the same, but you now use the tiger stat block.  \n   - You’re able to use a bite attack.  \n3. **Turn 2** – You attack with the bite, dealing 1d6 + 4 damage.  \n4. **Turn 3** – You want to fight a wizard, so you **Action** to go back to humanoid.  \n   - Your longsword is back in hand.  \n   - You regain spell‑casting (if you have it).  \n\nThat’s all there is to it.

Lifestyle Expenses Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls. At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.

Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease.

After paying the 45 gp expense, they have 15 gp left for equipment, saving, or other adventures.*\n\n3. **Adjust as needed**: If the character buys a new house, takes up a job, or decides to live frugally, change their lifestyle tier. The table is flexible and can be used by the DM to simulate the economic impact of a character’s choices.\n\n### Notes & Uncertainties\n\n- The table is a guideline; the DM may modify costs for specific campaigns, regions, or time periods.\n- The expenses are **monthly**, not daily. To get a daily cost, divide by roughly 30 (e.g., 45 gp/month ≈ 1.5 gp/day for a comfortable lifestyle).\n- The DMG’s table appears on page 15 (in the “Money, Wealth, and Currency” section). It is not part of the Player’s Handbook, so players must consult the DMG or a DM’s resource to use it.\n\nIn short, *Lifestyle Expenses* give a standardized way to determine how much gold a character needs to spend each month to maintain a particular standard of living, helping keep both player and DM on the same economic page.", "reference": "Lifestyle Expenses give a simple way to track the cost of living in a fantasy world.

Self-Sufficiency The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford-paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear. Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time--consuming.

Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills. Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke. Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean.

Spellcasting Services People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs. Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure woundsor identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment-the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement."], "response": "**Short‑answer**  \nUse a *core crew of low‑cost, everyday hirelings* (cook, housekeeper, clerk, stable‑master) to keep the party’s base running, then swap in *special‑purpose hirelings or city/wilderness services* on a mission‑by‑mission basis.  Pick hirelings whose skills give the party the most “free time” and “readiness” for both city and wilderness work, and keep a simple budget sheet to track days and costs.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  The “Base‑Camp” Hirelings\n\n| Hireling | Daily Cost* | Core Benefit | When to Use |\n|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Cook | 30 sp | Free up adventurers’ time to train, heal, or explore; improves morale & gives +1 to Survival checks while eating | Every day in town or while on a long quest |\n| Housekeeper | 8 sp | Keeps a small house or caravan tidy; reduces lost loot | Anytime you’re staying in a home or base |\n| Clerk / Bookkeeper | 1 sp | Manages treasure, invoices, contracts; prevents mis‑accounting | For any long‑term base or during treasure‑heavy campaigns |\n| Stable‑Master / Pack‑Mule Driver | 10 sp | Maintains mounts, ensures they’re fed, and drives wagons | Whenever you travel by road or wilderness |\n\n\\*These are the standard “per‑day” costs listed in *DMG 5.1*; you can negotiate if you’re only hiring them for a single day.\n\n### Why this works\n- **Time savings** – the party can focus on adventuring rather than cleaning or cooking.  \n- **Risk mitigation** – a cook’s special meals can heal or cure disease; a stable‑master keeps mounts healthy.  \n- **Budget control** – the costs are predictable; you can set a “base‑camp budget” and stay under it.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  “On‑Demand” Hirelings & Services\n\n| Hireling / Service | Typical Cost | Key Utility | Ideal Scenario |\n|--------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|\n| City Guide / Informant | 5–15 sp per day | Navigates city wards, avoids legal trouble, locates NPCs | Visiting a large city for a quest |\n| Guard / Bodyguard | 10–20 sp per day | Protects the party, defends a base | When you’re in a hostile city or after a raid |\n| Mercenary Band | 20–50 sp per day per fighter | Extra combat power, takes pressure off the party | Facing large enemies or a surprise ambush |\n| Blacksmith / Tinkerer | 5–10 sp per day | Repairs gear, upgrades weapons, creates custom items | After a long dungeon crawl |\n| Herbalist / Apothecary | 8–12 sp per day | Produces potions, antidotes | When you’re deep in a wilderness area with scarce resources |\n| Pack Mule or Caravan Driver | 10–15 sp per day | Moves large supplies; can transport you through rough terrain | For long overland travel or when you have a lot of loot |\n| Ship Crew / Portage Service | 15–30 sp per day | Transport across water; handles cargo | During sea travel or crossing a lake |\n\n**Tip:** Many of these can be contracted for a *single day* or *per mission* rather than a whole month. Use the *hireling rule* (cost × days) and decide whether the hireling’s daily cost is worth the time saved.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Budget‑Balancing Strategy\n\n| Category | Target Spend (per 30‑day cycle) | Typical Hirelings |\n|----------|--------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Living (housing, food) | 400–600 sp | Housekeeper, cook, clerk, small house rent |\n| Travel | 200–300 sp | Pack mule driver, caravan guard, ship crew |\n| Combat / Security | 150–250 sp | Guard, mercenary band |\n| Maintenance & Craft | 100–150 sp | Blacksmith, herbalist |\n| Misc / Contingency | 100 sp | City guide, informant, extra clerk |\n\n- **Track it** – Keep a simple ledger: `date | hireling | days | cost | notes`.  \n- **Negotiate** – If you’re staying at a tavern host, ask if they’ll cook for you; many hosts provide “all‑in‑one” services at a flat rate.  \n- **Leverage guilds** – Membership in a guild often gives you discounted rates or a standing retainer.  \n\n---\n\n## 4.  Tactical Deployment\n\n| Situation | Suggested Hireling(s) | Why |\n|-----------|-----------------------|-----|\n| **Urban Adventure** | Guard + City Guide + Clerk | Guard keeps you safe from city crime; guide helps you navigate bureaucracy; clerk keeps track of quests & rewards |\n| **Wilderness Trek** | Pack Mule Driver + Herbalist + Stable‑Master | Mule driver keeps your load moving; herbalist supplies medicine; stable‑master cares for mounts |\n| **Dungeon Crawl** | Cook + Blacksmith + Mercenary | Cook provides post‑fight meals; blacksmith repairs gear; mercenary adds firepower |\n| **Town Brawl / Siege** | Guard + Mercenary + City Guide | Guard defends, mercenary fights, guide directs to safe routes |\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Managing Risks & Flexibility\n\n1. **Hireling Reputation** – Use good references or hire from reputable shops. A shady cook can spoil food or a rogue guard can be a traitor.  \n2. **Contract Clauses** – If the DM allows, add a clause that the hireling must report to you; otherwise the DM may have full control.  \n3. **Multi‑skill Hirelings** – A ranger can double as a guide and a scout; a rogue can be a pickpocket or a lock‑picker.  \n4. **Seasonal Adjustments** – In winter, prioritize a stable‑master and a pack mule driver; in summer, maybe a hired guide to avoid heat exhaustion.  \n5. **Contingency Funds** – Keep a small stash of gold (e.g., 100 sp) for emergency hirelings or last‑minute repairs.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n- **Hire low‑cost, everyday support** (cook, housekeeper, clerk, stable‑master) to keep the party’s routine smooth.  \n- **Swap in higher‑value, mission‑specific hirelings** (guide, guard, mercenary, herbalist) as the adventure demands.  \n- **Track costs** in a simple ledger; set budget targets for each month.  \n- **Use local services** (innkeepers, tavern hosts, guilds) to bundle costs and get discounts.  \n- **Keep a flexible roster** – hire only what you need for the next city or wilderness stretch, then let them go when their role is finished.\n\nBy treating hirelings as *time‑savers* and *risk mitigators*, a party can stay lean, keep expenses predictable, and always be ready whether they’re negotiating a tavern’s politics or tracking a bandit in a forest.", "reference": "Adventurers can pay non‑player characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke. Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore.

You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).

You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Spellcasting By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. Preparing and Casting Spells The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.

Divine Health By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease. Sacred Oath When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature. Oath Spells Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. Channel Divinity Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra A ttack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Aura of Protection Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Aura of Courage Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Improved Divine Smite By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. Cleansing Touch Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. Sacred Oaths Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart. Oath of Devotion The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. Tenets of Devotion Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets. Honesty.Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. Turn the Unholy.As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Aura of Devotion Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Purity of Spirit Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and goodspell. Holy Nimbus At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Breaking Your Oath A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all--night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self--denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another."], "response": "**Turn the Unholy – The Paladin’s Oath of the Crown**\n\n| Feature | Where it Appears | What it Does | Lore |\n|---------|------------------|--------------|------|\n| **Turn the Unholy** | 5‑E Player’s Handbook, Oath of the Crown (PHB, p. 86) | *Channel Divinity*: Expending a spell slot, the paladin forces all fiends **or** undead within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature either is frightened or, in the case of a fiend, is turned away from the paladin’s presence (the wording is similar to the normal “Turn Undead” effect). | The Oath of the Crown is a holy creed dedicated to a deity who values order, justice, and the preservation of the realm against both the corrupting influence of the undead and the malevolent intent of fiends. The “turning” of unholy creatures reflects the paladin’s role as a divinely‑appointed judge who can command both necromantic and infernal forces to step back. It’s a literal extension of the idea that *all* unholy forces—whether raised from death or summoned from the lower planes—must be held at bay by the light of the oath. |\n\n### Quick Recap of the Mechanics\n- **Channel Divinity**: Used as an action, you expend a spell slot (any level) to activate the effect.\n- **Range**: 30 feet (within the paladin’s reach).\n- **Targets**: All fiends or all undead within range. They do **not** include both types at once; you choose one category per use.\n- **Saving Throw**: Wisdom (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier).\n- **Effect on Failure**:  \n  - **Undead**: Frightened for a short duration (like the standard Turn Undead).  \n  - **Fiends**: The creature is turned—essentially forced to flee the paladin’s presence or suffer a similar penalty as the Turn Undead effect.\n\n### Lore Notes\n- **The Oath’s Deity**: In many campaign settings, the Oath of the Crown is associated with a lawful good deity of justice (e.g., **Bahamut**, **Tyr**, or a setting‑specific god). The paladin’s “turning” power is a direct manifestation of that deity’s will to purge the world of corruption.\n- **Purpose**: The ability serves two roles: first, it protects the paladin’s allies from the immediate threat of a fiend or undead; second, it demonstrates the paladin’s divine authority, reminding enemies that the law of the realm—backed by the gods—holds sway over both necromancy and infernal magic.\n- **In Narrative**: You’ll often find paladins of the Crown in the front lines of the Crusades against the undead armies of necromancers or the invading hordes of demons. Their “turn” is an audible, radiant command that echoes the oath’s promise of “justice for all.”\n\n### Uncertainty\nIf you’re looking for an older edition (e.g., 3.5) version of “Turn the Unholy,” the feature was not named as such; the 3.5 *Turn Undead* ability did not include fiends. The 5e Oath of the Crown is the first official edition to combine the two in one ability.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you need more detail on how to role‑play a paladin using this feature or how it interacts with other classes’ abilities!", "reference": "Turn the Unholy is a Channel Divinity option that allows a paladin to present their holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallowspell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. Lay on Hands Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Spellcasting By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. Preparing and Casting Spells The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells whenyou finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from", "<2-hop>\n\ndragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures. Natural Explorer You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in. While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits: •Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel. •Your group can’t become lost except by magical means. •Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. •If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. •When you forage, you find twice as much food asyou normally would. •While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.You choose additional favored terrain types at 6thand 10th level. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Spellcasting By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. Spell Slots The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendshipusing either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus +your Wisdom modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus +your Wisdom modifier Ranger Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate, such as the Hunter. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Primeval Awareness Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Land’s Stride Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. Hide in Plain Sight Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself.

The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend. Divine Health By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease. Sacred Oath When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. Channel Divinity Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.

Aura of Courage Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. Cleansing Touch Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. Sacred Oaths Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart. Oath of Devotion The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallowspell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. Lay on Hands Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Spellcasting By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. Preparing and Casting Spells The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. Turn the Unholy.As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Aura of Devotion Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Purity of Spirit Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and goodspell. Holy Nimbus At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Breaking Your Oath A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all--night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self--denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.", "<2-hop>\n\nPaladin Class Features As a paladin, you gain the following class features.

The following entries appear among the traits of most races. Ability Score Increase Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores. Age The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom. Alignment Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character. Size Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.” Speed Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling ( “Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”). Languages By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Subraces Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world. Dwarf Dwarf Traits Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature. Ability Score Increase.Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years. Alignment. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order. Size.Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed.Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor. Darkvision.Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Dwarven Resilience. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. Dwarven Combat Training.You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer. Tool Proficiency.You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools. Stonecunning. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. Languages.You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak. Hill Dwarf As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Dwarven Toughness.

Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Languages.You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires. High Elf As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races. Ability Score Increase.Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. Cantrip.You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice. Halfling Halfling Traits Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings. Ability Score Increase.Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century. Alignment.Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways. Size.Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed.Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Lucky.When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Brave.You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. Halfling Nimbleness. You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling. Lightfoot As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others. Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1.

After the walk‑through I’ll compare those traits to the most common “other‑race” options (Dragonborn, Gnome, Half‑Orc, Tiefling) and give a quick sanity‑check for rules that only pop up in very specific situations.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Ability‑Score Increase  \n| Source | +2 Charisma | +1 to two other scores | Choice |\n|--------|------------|------------------------|--------|\n| PHB (p. 26) | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |\n| XGtE (p. 10) | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |\n\n**What it means**  \n- Charisma +2 is the same in both texts.  \n- You choose any two other ability scores to add +1 (e.g., Strength + 1 and Wisdom + 1).  \n- Because the wording is identical, there is no difference between the two segments.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Age  \n| Source | Typical Lifespan | Age of Maturity | Reaching Old Age |\n|--------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| PHB (p. 26) | 180 years | 20 | 150–180 |\n| XGtE (p. 10) | 180 years | 20 | 150–180 |\n\n**What it means**  \n- Half‑Elves mature at the same rate as Elves and Humans.  \n- There is no difference in the description between the two sources; the numbers are identical.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Alignment Tendencies  \n| Source | Typical Alignment |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| PHB (p. 26) | No particular tendency |\n| XGtE (p. 10) | No particular tendency |\n\n**What it means**  \n- Half‑Elves are “free‑spirited” and can fall into any alignment; the game gives no rule‑based restriction.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Size  \n| Source | Size |\n|--------|------|\n| PHB (p. 26) | Medium |\n| XGtE (p. 10) | Medium |\n\n**What it means**  \n- Medium size means the same hit‑die and space as other Medium characters. No difference.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Speed  \n| Source | Base Speed |\n|--------|------------|\n| PHB (p. 26) | 30 ft. |\n| XGtE (p. 10) | 30 ft. |\n\n**What it means**  \n- No special movement abilities; just the standard 30‑foot walk.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Darkvision  \n| Source | Range |\n|--------|-------|\n| PHB (p. 26) | 60 ft. |\n| XGtE (p. 10) | 60 ft. |\n\n**What it means**  \n- The range is the same in both texts; it simply means “you can see in dim light as if it were bright, and in darkness as if it were dim.”\n\n---\n\n## 7.  Fey Ancestry (advantage on saving throws against being charmed; resistance to magic that charmed)  \n| Source | Effect |\n|--------|--------|\n| PHB (p. 26) | “You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.” |\n| XGtE (p. 10) | Same wording; some writers prefer the shorter “You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed” – the “cannot be put to sleep” is a clarifying note that is implied by the first clause. |\n\n**What it means**  \n- The rule is identical; the wording difference is cosmetic.  \n- In practice, if a creature (e.g., a wizard) casts *Charm Person* on a Half‑Elf, the Half‑Elf automatically gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw.  \n- “Cannot be put to sleep” is a rarely‑used clause that comes into play only if a spell tries to use the *Sleep* effect directly on a half‑elf; the advantage on saving throws against *Charm Person* suffices in almost all situations.\n\n---\n\n## 8.  Skill Versatility  \n| Source | Two skills of your choice |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| PHB (p. 26) | ✔ |\n| XGtE (p. 10) | ✔ |\n\n**What it means**  \n- You get proficiency in any two skills you’re not already proficient in.  \n- The PHB lists “Skill Versatility” as a single bullet; XGtE phrases it in the same way. No difference.\n\n---\n\n## 9.  Languages  \n| Source | Languages Known |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| PHB (p. 26) | Common, Elvish |\n| XGtE (p. 10) | Common, Elvish |\n\n**What it means**  \n- These are the only languages that come for free. You can learn others via class features or the *Comprehend Languages* spell, but that’s not part of the racial trait.\n\n---\n\n## 10.  Other Notable Traits (none)  \nBoth the PHB and XGtE list **only** the traits above. There are no “extra” Half‑Elf bonuses (e.g., a special ability to see through mist, or a racial spell) that appear in either text.\n\n---\n\n## 11.  Comparison with Other Common Races  \n| Race | Key Ability Increases | Core Racial Traits | How They Stack Against Half‑Elves |\n|------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Dragonborn** | +2 Strength, +1 Charisma | Breath weapon (once per short rest), damage resistance | Dragonborn favor melee, Half‑Elves favor social/utility |\n| **Gnome** | +2 Intelligence, +1 Dexterity | Darkvision 60 ft, +1 bonus to saving throws vs. *magic that turns* | Gnomes are arcane‑skilled, Half‑Elves are charismatic |\n| **Half‑Orc** | +2 Strength, +1 Constitution | Relentless Endurance, Savage Attacks | Half‑Orcs are tougher, Half‑Elves are versatile |\n| **Tiefling** | +2 Charisma, +1 Intelligence or Wisdom | Darkvision 60 ft, Hellish Resistance (fire), infernal legacy (can cast *Thaumaturgy* or *Hellish Rebuke* once per day) | Tieflings have fire resistance and a built‑in spell; Half‑Elves have Fey ancestry and skill versatility |\n\n**Quick sanity checks**  \n- **Rarely used**: Fey ancestry advantage is only called out in a *Charm Person* or *Hold Person* encounter; if you’re playing a campaign where no one casts those, the trait is effectively silent.  \n- **Skill versatility**: You’ll only notice this if you want to cover a niche skill that isn’t offered by your class (e.g., *Insight* if you’re a rogue).  \n- **Darkvision**: Only matters in low‑light or darkness situations; if your DM never uses darkness, you’ll never see it in action.  \n\n---\n\n## 12.  Summary of Segment Differences  \n| Trait | <1‑hop> (PHB) | <2‑hop> (XGtE) | Difference |\n|-------|--------------|---------------|------------|\n| Ability Score | Same | Same | None |\n| Age | Same | Same | None |\n| Alignment | Same | Same | None |\n| Size | Same | Same | None |\n| Speed | Same | Same | None |\n| Darkvision | Same | Same | None |\n| Fey Ancestry | Same | Same (wording slightly condensed) | Cosmetic |\n| Skill Versatility | Same | Same | None |\n| Languages | Same | Same | None |\n\n**Bottom line** – the Half‑Elf racial traits are *identical* between the PHB and XGtE; any wording differences are purely editorial. The lore (the “fey ancestry” and “skill versatility” themes) is the same across both sources, so there is no risk of pulling contradictory rules from different segments.\n\n---\n\n### Quick “Yes/No” sanity checklist (for novice players)\n\n| Rule | Do I need to remember it? | When does it matter? |\n|------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Charisma +2 | ✔ | Any social, spellcasting, or skill that uses Charisma |\n| +1 to two scores | ✔ | Depending on your class, choose the ones that help you |\n| Fey ancestry advantage on Charm | ✔ | In campaigns with mind‑control or *Charm Person* |\n| Skill versatility | ✔ | If you want two extra skills |\n| Darkvision 60 ft | ✔ | If you ever find yourself in dim or dark areas |\n| 30‑ft speed | ✔ | Always, but rarely a factor unless you’re in a race |\n| Languages (Common, Elvish) | ✔ | For basic communication and lore |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line for a novice:  \n\n- Half‑Elves give you **versatility**: you get a big Charisma boost, two extra skill proficiencies, and a useful “fey” defensive edge.  \n- Compared to the other major options, you’re not the strongest in combat or magic, but you’re a solid choice for any class that benefits from Charisma or needs to cover many skills.  \n- The two source books agree, so you can safely use whichever you prefer.  \n\nGood luck, and may your Half‑Elf’s charm win you favor at every table!", "reference": "**Half‑Elf Traits (Combined from <1‑hop> and <2‑hop>)**\n\n1. **Ability Score Increase** – Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.\n2. **Age** – Half‑elves mature at the same rate as humans, reaching adulthood around 20 years old.

They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Languages.You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires. High Elf As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races. Ability Score Increase.Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Elf Weapon Training.

They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways. Size.Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed.Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Lucky.When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Brave.You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. Halfling Nimbleness. You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling. Lightfoot As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others. Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1.

Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Hellish Resistance. You have resistance to fire damage. Infernal Legacy. You know the thaumaturgy cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the hellish rebuke spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

The key linguistic distinction is the half‑elf’s extra language of choice, which grants them broader communicative flexibility. Their other shared traits (e.g., charm resistance) reinforce their reliability in enchanted or social settings, while the half‑elf’s additional skill proficiencies and magic‑sleep immunity can further enhance their versatility. In a campaign, these differences often dictate whether a character is best suited as a diplomat, scout, or frontline adventurer.", "reference": "Elves can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish, while half‑elves can do the same plus one extra language of their choice.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit. Sneak Attack Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. Thieves’ Cant During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. Cunning Action Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. Roguish Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities, such as Thief. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Uncanny Dodge Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you. Evasion Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Reliable Talent By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. Blindsense Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. Slippery Mind By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. Elusive Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated. Stroke of Luck At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Roguish Archetypes Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques. Thief You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators.

The feat gives you  \n\n| Effect | What it means for your play‑style |\n|--------|----------------------------------|\n| **+ proficiency bonus to Stealth checks while wearing armor** | Your party can infiltrate a fortified city in full chainmail and still be “undetectable.” |\n| **Stealth checks while standing in bright light** | The “stealth in bright light” trope no longer forces you to move to shadow.  Imagine a rogue sliding through a torch‑lit tavern. |\n| **Sneak Attack while hidden** | You get that extra damage even when you’re *not* already having advantage.  No more “need a partner or advantage” – you can swing the dagger on your own. |\n\nThese mechanics let you weave a **stealth‑legend** into your game in a few easy ways:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Give the character a *legendary name* and a *backstory*\n\n- **Name:** “Silk‑Shadow,” “The Whisper,” “Gloomblade” – anything that sounds like a mythic figure.  \n- **Backstory hook:** The character was once the personal body‑guard of a fallen king, or was raised in the hidden thieves’ guild that never saw the light.  \n- **NPC reactions:** Guards look twice at them, townsfolk whisper “the one who slipped through the blaze,” and even enemies say “I’d rather meet the *Shadow* in my dreams than in combat.”  \n\nA simple lore line that everyone knows your character has “topped the list of the city’s most successful infiltrators” instantly turns mundane stealth into a story beat.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Use the feat to break the *“stealth = darkness”* rule\n\n1. **Bright‑light infiltration**  \n   - *Scenario:* The party has to get past a heavily guarded courtyard that’s lit by torches and spell‑lamps.  \n   - *Mechanics:* The character can stay on the **bright** side of the light, make a Stealth check, and the DM may allow them to “slide in the shadow of a pillar or behind a banner,” giving a dramatic visual that feels like a legend.  \n   - *Role‑play:* “You slip into the fire‑lit alley, as if the light itself bends to your will.”\n\n2. **Armor‑stealth combos**  \n   - *Scenario:* The heroes are a mix of fighters and rogues. The fighter wants to sneak past a guard because he can’t hide.  \n   - *Mechanics:* With Supreme Sneak, the fighter gains the proficiency bonus on Stealth checks while wearing the chainmail, making it a *legends‑level* act of stealth.  \n   - *Role‑play:* “Your heavy armor clinks, but your steps are quiet as a snowfall.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. Turn Sneak Attack into a “one‑shot legend”\n\n- **Hidden, then strike**: Even when you’re not normally under the Sneak Attack conditions, you can still deliver that extra damage.  \n- **Narrative flair**: “When you’re hidden, you become a whisper in the dark.  With a single dart of your dagger, you cut through the enemy’s heart.”  \n\nYou can even **build a signature move** (e.g., a “Shadow‑Stab”) that the DM calls out: “A glint of silver in the torchlight—your dagger, silent as a ghost, finds the seam in the guard’s armor.”  The DM can give a “legendary roll” bonus for that signature strike.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Craft “stealth‑legend” side quests\n\n| Quest idea | How it uses Supreme Sneak | Legendary flavor |\n|------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| *The Heist of the City Hall* | Stealth checks in bright light to break into the guarded treasury. | NPCs talk of the “Shadow” who stole the city’s most guarded relic. |\n| *Infiltrate the Enchanted Tower* | Armor‑stealth to bypass wards and watch the wizard’s plans. | You’re told the tower’s defenders swear the intruder is “the ghost in the glass.” |\n| *Recover a stolen artifact* | Sneak Attack while hidden to take down a lone guard in a corridor. | The artifact’s original owner sends a letter: “May the Shadow who stole it not be found.” |\n\nGive the PCs **rewards that echo the legend**: a “Silverscale Cloak” that grants a +2 bonus to Stealth in bright light, or a “Glyph of the Shadow” that allows a one‑day stealth “phase” where you’re treated as if you’re in dim light, even in day.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Use the *Supreme Sneak* narrative in encounters\n\n1. **Guard patrols** – Have a guard look at a *shadow* slipping past while the rest of the party watches. The guard says, “Who’s that?” The DM can treat the character as a *famous figure* who often “passes through the fire without a scorch.”  \n2. **Clever cover** – The party could use a lamppost, a stack of crates, or a moving caravan as cover. The Supreme Sneak feat can allow the character to “hide in plain sight” even while the light is harsh, turning the environment into a playground for legendary moves.  \n3. **Crowd‑sneaking** – A bustling market with bright lanterns: the character slips between people as if invisible, making the crowd’s reaction “You’ve seen a shadow in daylight, my friend.”  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Build “Legend Status” into the game mechanics\n\n- **Legend Reputation**: Every time a stealth check is successful thanks to Supreme Sneak, the DM can award a “Legend Point.”  Once you have a certain number, NPCs might give you a free side quest, or a guard might drop their weapon in respect.  \n- **Legendary Items**: Create gear that “enhances the Supreme Sneak” – e.g., a pair of boots that grant *+1 to Stealth while wearing armor*, or a cloak that allows you to *hide even when the light is bright*.  \n- **Story‑Driven Rewards**: The city might let you stay in a safe house because “the Shadow keeps us safe.”  \n\nThese small narrative flourishes make the Supreme Sneak feel like a *legendary* ability rather than a flat mechanical tweak.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Sample “Legend‑In‑Action” Moment\n\n> **Scene**: The city’s night watch has set up a line of torch‑lit sentries in the courtyard.  \n> **Player**: “I’ll go first.”  \n> **DM**: *You step forward into the bright glow, your chainmail clinking, but your movements are so precise that the torches seem to flicker around you.  Roll Stealth.*  \n> **Player**: (Rolls a 20 + prof + armor bonus)  \n> **DM**: “You vanish into a patch of darkness behind the stone pillar—no one notices.  The guard turns, but you’re already past him.  Your dagger finds the gap in his breastplate, and you deliver a Sneak Attack.  The guard falls.”  \n> **Narrative**: “The night watch murmurs: ‘That was no mere thief.  That was the Shadow… and he slipped in bright as the sun.’”\n\nA moment like that, combined with the lore hooks above, will make the *Supreme Sneak* feel like a real, whispered legend in your campaign.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Mechanical boost**: +proficiency in armor, Stealth in bright light, Sneak Attack while hidden.  \n- **Narrative hook**: Name, backstory, and NPC recognition that your character is a *legend*.  \n- **Story devices**: Light‑based stealth, armor‑stealth, signature moves, side quests, and reputation rewards.  \n- **Legend status**: Give the party tangible benefits that echo their “shadowy” reputation.\n\nDrop the lore, roll the checks, and let the party’s stealth become the stuff of legend in your world.  With Supreme Sneak, they’re not just sneaking—they’re *shadow‑walking* in the light, and the city will forever talk about it.", "reference": "Supreme Sneak gives you advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.", "answer_relevancy": 0.6964089962220948, "semantic_similarity": 0.2728148593917505, "bleu_score": 0.030162008631007292, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.026644462947543714, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.013582342954159592, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.6956521739130435}

Careful Spell When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. Distant Spell When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet. Empowered Spell When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Extended Spell When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours. Heightened Spell When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell. Quickened Spell When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. Subtle Spell When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components. Twinned Spell When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

Sorcerous Origins Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic, such as a draconic bloodline. Draconic Bloodline Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance. Dragon Ancestor At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later. Draconic Ancestry Dragon Damage Type Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Gold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check. Draconic Resilience As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon -like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. ElementalAffinityStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour. Dragon Wings At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn. You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. Draconic Presence Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours."], "response": "**Sorcerer Ability Score Improvement – PHB**\n\n- **Feature text (Sorcerer class, p. 68):**  \n  “At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1 each.”  \n\n- **How many times can it be used?**  \n  Five times (levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20).  \n\n- **Limits on the increase:**  \n  • You may add **+2** to a single ability or **+1** to two distinct abilities.  \n  • **Cannot raise an ability score above 20.** (PHB, p. 169 – “When you increase an ability score, you can’t increase it above 20.”)  \n\n- **Scores above 20:**  \n  The feature **does not apply** to scores above 20; the cap is absolute unless overridden by a spell (e.g., *Wish*) or DM‑approved magic.  \n\n- **Interaction with the max cap of 20:**  \n  If a score is already 20, you must choose a different ability to increase or take the +1/+1 option.  \n\n- **Subtle lore nuance:**  \n  The 20‑point ceiling represents the pinnacle of mortal potential.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit. Sneak Attack Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. Thieves’ Cant During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. Cunning Action Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. Roguish Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities, such as Thief. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Uncanny Dodge Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you. Evasion Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Reliable Talent By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. Blindsense Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. Slippery Mind By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. Elusive Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated. Stroke of Luck At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Roguish Archetypes Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit. Sneak Attack Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. Thieves’ Cant During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. Cunning Action Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. Roguish Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities, such as Thief. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Uncanny Dodge Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you. Evasion Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Reliable Talent By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. Blindsense Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. Slippery Mind By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. Elusive Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated. Stroke of Luck At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Roguish Archetypes Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes.

Using it to **Disengage**\n\n* **When to use it:** You want to move away from an enemy without provoking an opportunity attack.  \n* **Effect:** Your movement that turn is “safe” – you don’t trigger an enemy’s reaction when you leave a square adjacent to them.  \n* **Typical use‑case:** A rogue who needs to get behind cover or reposition to a better line of sight for a sneak attack.\n\n**Example**  \nTurn 1:  \n- Action: Attack a goblin with a shortbow (no sneak).  \n- Bonus Action (Cunning Action): Disengage.  \n- Move: 30 ft to the left, now out of the goblin’s reach.  \nThe goblin can’t make a reaction attack on your move.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Using it to **Hide**\n\n* **When to use it:** You want to become unseen (or at least not “detected”) by an enemy so that you can make a sneak attack or simply avoid detection.  \n* **Prerequisites:**  \n  * You must have a *hiding spot*: cover (e.g., a pillar, a doorway, or a wall), darkness, or any obstacle that gives you half cover or better.  \n  * If you are *not* in cover, you must succeed on a Dexterity (Stealth) check.  \n* **Effect:** While hidden, you gain advantage on attack rolls against a creature that can’t see you, and the creature can’t make opportunity attacks on you.  \n* **Limitations:**  \n  * The enemy must not have advantage on its perception of you (unless you are truly invisible).  \n  * If the enemy has *advantage* on its Perception, you’re still hidden but the enemy may catch you on a subsequent check.  \n  * You can’t *hide* while you’re actively attacking unless you use the Hide action as a **bonus** action (Cunning Action) *before* you attack.\n\n**PHB §173 – “Hiding”**  \n> “If you’re in cover, you can use the Hide action without a check. Otherwise, you must make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. If you succeed, you’re hidden. If you fail, you’re not hidden.”\n\n**Example**  \nTurn 2:  \n- Action: Attack a wolf with a dagger (use Sneak Attack).  \n- Bonus Action (Cunning Action): Hide.  \n- You’re now hidden from the wolf; it can’t see you, so you’ll have advantage on the next attack you make against it.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference: What can you do with each option?\n\n| Cunning Action option | What it gives you | Common tactical benefit |\n|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| **Dash** | Extra movement of your speed | Move to a better position or escape | \n| **Disengage** | Move without provoking attacks | Safely retreat or reposition |\n| **Hide** | Be unseen, advantage on attack rolls, no opportunity attacks | Sneak attack, stay out of sight, avoid damage |\n\n---\n\n## Tips & Edge Cases\n\n| Scenario | How Cunning Action Helps | Extra Note |\n|----------|--------------------------|------------|\n| **You’re already using your action for an attack** | Still can use Cunning Action to Disengage or Hide (you’ll need to choose which). | If you use *Hide*, you won’t attack this turn; you’ll need a later turn to attack with sneak attack. |\n| **You’re in a tight space** | Use Disengage to slip out of melee range before the enemy’s turn. | You can also use a bonus action *Dash* (not Hide) to reach the edge of the area of effect. |\n| **The enemy has a ranged attack** | Hide in cover to avoid being targeted, then use your action for an attack. | If the enemy can see through your cover, you might need to roll Stealth. |\n| **You’re in a dimly lit area** | You can hide in darkness without a Stealth check. | DM may allow you to hide “by default” if you’re in dim or dark light. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA rogue can *every turn* decide whether to **Disengage** (move safely) or **Hide** (become unseen).  \nBecause it’s a bonus action, you still have your full action available for attacks, spells, or other maneuvers.  \nUse Disengage when you need to back off without risk, and use Hide when you want to get the advantage on your next attack or stay out of enemy sight.", "reference": "At 2nd level, a rogue can use Cunning Action to take a bonus action on each turn in combat.

A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.  Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.  Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.\n\nCreating Sentient Magic Items\nWhen you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.\n\nAbilities\nA sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.\n\nCommunication\nA sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.\nd100   Communication                                                                                                                                                          \n01-60  The item communicates by transmitting emotion  to the creature carrying or wielding it.                                                                                \n61-90  The item can speak, read, and understand one  or more languages.                                                                                                       \n91-00  The item can speak, read, and understand one  or more languages. In addition, the item can  communicate telepathically with any character  that carries or wields it.  \n\n\nSenses\nWith sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table.\nd4  Senses                                      \n1   Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.   \n2   Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet    \n3   Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet.  \n4   Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.     \n\n\nAlignment\nA sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table.\nd100     Alignment        d100     Alignment        \n01 - 15  Lawful good      74 - 85  Chaotic neutral  \n16 - 35  Neutral good     86 - 89  Lawful evil      \n36 - 50  Chaotic good     90 - 96  Neutral evil     \n51 - 63  Lawful  neutral  97 - 00  Chaotic evil     \n64 - 73  Neutral          \n\n\nSpecial Purpose\nYou can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You\ncan pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.\nd10  Purpose                                                                                                                                   \n1    Aligned:  The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a  diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is  never neutral.)              \n2    Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of  a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls,  or wizards.            \n3    Pro tector:  The item seeks to defend a particular race  or kind of creature, such as elves or druids.                                    \n4    Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or  destroy the servants of a particular deity.                                               \n5    Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and  interests o f a particular deity.                                                     \n6    Destroyer: The item craves destruction and goads its  user to fight arbitrarily.                                                          \n7    Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the greatest  magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a  famous or notorious figure.  \n8    Lore  Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is  determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or  unravel a cryptic prophecy.             \n9    Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its  wielder have key roles to play in future events.                                   \n10   Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and wants  to understand why it was created.                                                   \n\n\nConflict\nA sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:\n•The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.\n•The item demands that its wielder dispose ofanything the item finds repugnant.\n•The item demands that its wielder pursue theitem’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.\n•The item demands to be given to someone else.If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’swishes, the item can do any or all of the following:\n•Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.\n•Suppress one or more of its activated properties.\n•Attempt to take control of its wielder.If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn.\n\nArtifacts\n\nOrb of Dragonkind\nWondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)\nAges past,elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five\nOrbs of Dragonkind\n(or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow\nsome measure of control over dragons.\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma\ncheck. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts\nsuggestionon you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the\nworld, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\nRandom Properties. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:\n•2 minor beneficial properties\n•1 minor detrimental property\n•1 major detrimental property\nSpells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18)from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges),or scrying (3 charges).You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.\nCall Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.\nDestroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.\n\n\nMonsters\nA monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its\nstat block, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.\n\nSize\nA monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the Player’s Handbook for more information on creature size and space.\n\nSize Categories\nSize        Space                   Examples             \nTiny        2½ by 2½ ft.            Imp, sprite          \nSmall       5 by 5 ft.              Giant rat, goblin    \nMedium      5 by 5 ft.              Orc, werewolf        \nLarge       10 by 10 ft.            Hippogriff, ogre     \nHuge        15 by 15 ft.            Fire giant, treant   \nGargantuan  20 by 20 ft. or larger  Kraken, purple worm  \n\n\nModifying Creatures\nDespite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a\nvariant or\ntemplate, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.\n\nType\nA monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.  The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.\nAberrations are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.\nBeasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.\nCelestialsare creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.\nConstructsare made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.\nDragonsare large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.\nElementals are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers and invisible stalkers.\nFeyare magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.\nFiendsare creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.\nGiants tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.\nHumanoids are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.\nMonstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense-frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.\nOozes are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.\nPlants in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.\nUndead are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.\n\nTags\nA monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.\n\nAlignment\nA monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack\ncharacters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the\nPlayer’s Handbookfor descriptions of the different alignments.\nThe alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change\na monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.\nSome creatures can have\nany alignment. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.\nMany creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are\nunaligned, which means they don’t have an alignment.\n\nArmor Class\nA monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.\n\nHit Points\nA monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the\nPlayer’s Handbook.\nA monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).\nA monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.\n\nHit Dice by Size\nMonster Size  Hit Die  Average HP per Die  \nTiny          d4       2½                  \nSmall         d6       3½                  \nMedium        d8       4½                  \nLarge         d10      5½                  \nHuge          d12      6½                  \nGargantuan    d20      10½                 \n\nA monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).\n\nSpeed\nA monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the Player’s Handbook.  All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.  Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.\n\nBurrow\nA monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.\n\nClimb\nA monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.\n\nFly\nA monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to\nhover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the Player’s Handbook). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.\n\nSwim\nA monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.\n\nAbility Scores\nEvery monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used in play, see the\nPlayer’s Handbook.\n\nSaving Throws\nThe Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.\nA saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).\n\nProficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating\nChallenge  Proficiency  Bonus  Challenge  Proficiency  Bonus  \n0          +2                  14         +5                  \n1/8        +2                  15         +5                  \n1/4        +2                  16         +5                  \n1/2        +2                  17         +6                  \n1          +2                  18         +6                  \n2          +2                  19         +6                  \n3          +2                  20         +6                  \n4          +2                  21         +7                  \n5          +3                  22         +7                  \n6          +3                  23         +7                  \n7          +3                  24         +7                  \n8          +3                  25         +8                  \n9          +4                  26         +8                  \n10         +4                  27         +8                  \n11         +4                  28         +8                  \n12         +4                  29         +9                  \n13         +5                  30         +9                  \n\n\nSkills\nThe Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\nA skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a\nmonster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.\n\nVulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities\nSome creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.\n\nSenses\nThe Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.\n\nBlindsight\nA monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.   Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.  If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.\n\nDarkvision\nA monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.\n\nArmor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies\nAssume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment. For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither. See the\nPlayer’s Handbook for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.\n\nTremorsense\nA monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many\nburrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.\n\nTruesight\nA monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.\n\nLanguages\nThe languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A “-” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.\n\nTelepathy\nTelepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.\nA telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.\nA creature within the area of an antimagic fieldor in any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic messages.\n\nChallenge\nA monster’s\nchallenge rating tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.  Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.  Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.\n\nExperience Points\nThe number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.  Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.\n\nExperience Points by Challenge Rating\nChallenge  XP       Challenge  XP       \n0          0 or 10  14         11,500   \n1/8        25       15         13,000   \n1/4        50       16         15,000   \n1/2        100      17         18,000   \n1          200      18         20,000   \n2          450      19         22,000   \n3          700      20         25,000   \n4          1,100    21         33,000   \n5          1,800    22         41,000   \n6          2,300    23         50,000   \n7          2,900    24         62,000   \n8          3,900    25         75,000   \n9          5,000    26         90,000   \n10         5,900    27         105,000  \n11         7,200    28         120,000  \n12         8,400    29         135,000  \n13         10,000   30         155,000  \n\n\nSpecial Traits\nSpecial traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.\n\nInnate Spellcasting\nA monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.\nAn innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the\nlevitatespell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.\nA monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells. If a monster’s innate spells don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.\n\nSpellcasting\nA monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as\nexplained in the\nPlayer’s Handbook). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.\nThe monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when at tuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.\nA monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level\nlightning boltspell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.\nYou can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.\n\nPsionics\nA monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.\n\nActions\nWhen a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the Player’s Handbook.\n\nMelee and Ranged Attacks\nThe most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the Player’s Handbook.\nCreature vs. Target. The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.\nHit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “Hit” notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.\nMiss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the “Miss:” notation.\n\nMultiattack\nA creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.\n\nAmmunition\nA monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.\n\nReactions\nIf a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.\n\nLimited Usage\nSome special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.\nX/Day.The notation “X/Day” means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.\nRecharge X-Y.The notation “Recharge X-Y” means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.\nFor example, “Recharge 5-6” means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.\nRecharge after a Short or Long Rest.This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.\n\nGrapple Rules for Monsters\nMany monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.\nA creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster’s stat block. If no\nescape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster’s Strength (Athletics) modifier.\n\nEquipment\nA stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.\nYou can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.  If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.\n\nLegendary Creatures\nA legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.  If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.\n\nLegendary Actions\nA legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions-called legendary actions-outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.\n\nA Legendary Creature’s Lair\nA legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.\n\nLair Actions\nIf a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.\n\nRegional Effects\nThe mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.\n"], "response": "**Artifacts – What They Are and How They Work**\n\n| Edition | Definition | Rarity | Typical Features | How the DM Uses Them |\n|---------|-------------|--------|------------------|----------------------|\n| **3.5/4e** | “Objects of immense power, usually tied to a god, legend, or cosmic force.” | *Artifact* (rarest of rare) | • Stat block like a monster (AC, hit points, saves).  <br>• Special abilities that can affect the world (e.g., *Orb of Dragonkind* can summon a dragon).  <br>• Usually *attuned* to a character of a certain alignment or class.  <br>• May carry curses, side‑effects, or require a quest to use. | Treat them as plot‑hooks or campaign‑climaxes.  They can change the story, grant legendary powers, or become a villain’s goal.  Use the “Artifact” tables in the DMG for rarity, cost, and description. |\n| **5e** | “One‑of‑a‑kind items that embody the power of a deity, dragon, or ancient event.” | *Artifact* (extremely rare) | • Rarity “Artifact” (not listed in the normal rarity table).  <br>• Often *requires attunement* and can grant powerful, single‑use effects.  <br>• Can have “side‑effects” (e.g., a dragon‑breath orb gives advantage on saves vs. dragon breath).  <br>• DMG §140–141 gives guidelines: create a stat line, decide on a “flavor” or mythic story, and include a “cursed” side‑effect if you want a risk‑reward element. | Use them sparingly.  An artifact can be the goal of an epic adventure, a tool for the party’s ultimate challenge, or a relic that can change the balance of a world.  The DM is free to tailor the artifact’s power to fit the story; the DMG gives a flexible template, not a rigid rule set. |\n\n**Key Take‑aways**\n\n1. **Artifacts are unique** – there is usually only one (or a handful) of a particular artifact in a setting.  \n2. **They are powerful** – most can grant abilities that rival or exceed a character’s full level.  \n3. **They often require conditions** – many are attuned to a certain class, alignment, or even a specific set of actions.  \n4. **They can be dangerous** – side‑effects, curses, or a “break‑off” mechanism (e.g., “once used, the artifact is destroyed”) are common.  \n5. **They’re a storytelling tool** – DMs use artifacts to raise stakes, introduce legend, or create a climactic finale.\n\n---\n\n## The Orb of Dragonkind\n\n| Edition | Source | Rarity | Requires Attunement? | Primary Ability |\n|---------|--------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| **5e** | *Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons* (or DMG for home‑brew variants) | Very Rare (Artifact‑class item) | Yes | *Dragon‑Breath*: Once per long rest, the attuned character can unleash a 20‑foot cone of damage that deals **5d6** of a type determined by the dragon the orb is attuned to (acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison). The orb grants **advantage on all saves against dragon breath damage** while attuned. |\n| **3.5** | *Fiendish Codex II: Tyrant’s Throne* (or *Complete Divine*) | Artifact | Yes | The orb grants the user the ability to *Summon a Dragon* or *Transform into a Dragon* for a limited time (usually 1 minute per level of the user). It also bestows immunity to dragon breath damage for the duration. |\n\n**Short text from the 5e description**\n\n> **Orb of Dragonkind**  \n> *very rare, requires attunement*  \n> While you are attuned to this orb, you gain advantage on saving throws against dragon breath damage. Once per long rest, you can use an action to unleash a dragon’s breath weapon—a 20‑foot cone that deals 5d6 damage of the type of dragon the orb is attuned to. You may choose the dragon type each time you use the ability. The orb’s effect ends after you use it once per long rest.\n\n*(Numbers are based on the typical 5e “dragon breath” damage for a 20‑foot cone; feel free to adjust to fit your campaign.)*\n\n---\n\n### How the Orb Fits into a Campaign\n\n- **Plot hook** – The party may seek the orb to gain dragon‑breath powers, to ward against an invading dragon, or to defeat a dragon‑raised villain.  \n- **Balance** – Because it is a *very rare* item, it is rarely given to the party unless the DM has a specific reason (e.g., a quest to earn it, a bargain with a dragon, or a sacrifice of a powerful ally).  \n- **Side‑effects** – The orb’s advantage on saves against dragon breath can be a neat narrative twist: “The dragon’s breath only works on those who do not have the orb.”  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **Artifacts** are the most powerful, story‑driving magic items.  In 5e, they are “Artifact” rarity, usually require attunement, and can grant extraordinary abilities (or curses).  \n- The **Orb of Dragonkind** is a classic example: a very rare, attunement‑required item that gives the user a dragon‑breath ability and protects against dragon breath damage.  Its exact numbers may vary by DM, but the core concept remains a powerful, dragon‑themed power that can be used once per long rest.  \n\nUse artifacts sparingly, and let them serve the story you’re telling—whether that’s a legendary quest, an epic showdown, or a twist that reshapes the world.", "reference": "Artifacts are powerful magic items that often require attunement.

{"user_input": "Hey, i need to know about Size in the game, how it works, what are the categories, how big each one is, give me examples of monsters that fit each size category, and how it affects the space a creature controls in combat, can you explain all that?", "reference_contexts": ["Sentient Magic Items\nSome magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.  Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.  Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.\n\nCreating Sentient Magic Items\nWhen you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.\n\nAbilities\nA sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.\n\nCommunication\nA sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.\nd100   Communication                                                                                                                                                          \n01-60  The item communicates by transmitting emotion  to the creature carrying or wielding it.                                                                                \n61-90  The item can speak, read, and understand one  or more languages.                                                                                                       \n91-00  The item can speak, read, and understand one  or more languages. In addition, the item can  communicate telepathically with any character  that carries or wields it.  \n\n\nSenses\nWith sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table.\nd4  Senses                                      \n1   Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.   \n2   Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet    \n3   Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet.  \n4   Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.     \n\n\nAlignment\nA sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table.\nd100     Alignment        d100     Alignment        \n01 - 15  Lawful good      74 - 85  Chaotic neutral  \n16 - 35  Neutral good     86 - 89  Lawful evil      \n36 - 50  Chaotic good     90 - 96  Neutral evil     \n51 - 63  Lawful  neutral  97 - 00  Chaotic evil     \n64 - 73  Neutral          \n\n\nSpecial Purpose\nYou can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You\ncan pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.\nd10  Purpose                                                                                                                                   \n1    Aligned:  The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a  diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is  never neutral.)              \n2    Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of  a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls,  or wizards.            \n3    Pro tector:  The item seeks to defend a particular race  or kind of creature, such as elves or druids.                                    \n4    Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or  destroy the servants of a particular deity.                                               \n5    Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and  interests o f a particular deity.                                                     \n6    Destroyer: The item craves destruction and goads its  user to fight arbitrarily.                                                          \n7    Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the greatest  magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a  famous or notorious figure.  \n8    Lore  Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is  determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or  unravel a cryptic prophecy.             \n9    Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its  wielder have key roles to play in future events.                                   \n10   Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and wants  to understand why it was created.                                                   \n\n\nConflict\nA sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:\n•The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.\n•The item demands that its wielder dispose ofanything the item finds repugnant.\n•The item demands that its wielder pursue theitem’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.\n•The item demands to be given to someone else.If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’swishes, the item can do any or all of the following:\n•Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.\n•Suppress one or more of its activated properties.\n•Attempt to take control of its wielder.If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn.\n\nArtifacts\n\nOrb of Dragonkind\nWondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)\nAges past,elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five\nOrbs of Dragonkind\n(or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow\nsome measure of control over dragons.\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma\ncheck. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts\nsuggestionon you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the\nworld, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\nRandom Properties. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:\n•2 minor beneficial properties\n•1 minor detrimental property\n•1 major detrimental property\nSpells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18)from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges),or scrying (3 charges).You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.\nCall Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.\nDestroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.\n\n\nMonsters\nA monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its\nstat block, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.\n\nSize\nA monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the Player’s Handbook for more information on creature size and space.\n\nSize Categories\nSize        Space                   Examples             \nTiny        2½ by 2½ ft.            Imp, sprite          \nSmall       5 by 5 ft.              Giant rat, goblin    \nMedium      5 by 5 ft.              Orc, werewolf        \nLarge       10 by 10 ft.            Hippogriff, ogre     \nHuge        15 by 15 ft.            Fire giant, treant   \nGargantuan  20 by 20 ft. or larger  Kraken, purple worm  \n\n\nModifying Creatures\nDespite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a\nvariant or\ntemplate, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.\n\nType\nA monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.  The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.\nAberrations are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.\nBeasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.\nCelestialsare creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.\nConstructsare made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.\nDragonsare large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.\nElementals are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers and invisible stalkers.\nFeyare magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.\nFiendsare creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.\nGiants tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.\nHumanoids are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.\nMonstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense-frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit into any other type.\nOozes are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.\nPlants in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.\nUndead are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.\n\nTags\nA monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.\n\nAlignment\nA monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack\ncharacters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the\nPlayer’s Handbookfor descriptions of the different alignments.\nThe alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change\na monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.\nSome creatures can have\nany alignment. In other words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.\nMany creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are\nunaligned, which means they don’t have an alignment.\n\nArmor Class\nA monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.\n\nHit Points\nA monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the\nPlayer’s Handbook.\nA monster’s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).\nA monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.\n\nHit Dice by Size\nMonster Size  Hit Die  Average HP per Die  \nTiny          d4       2½                  \nSmall         d6       3½                  \nMedium        d8       4½                  \nLarge         d10      5½                  \nHuge          d12      6½                  \nGargantuan    d20      10½                 \n\nA monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).\n\nSpeed\nA monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the Player’s Handbook.  All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.  Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.\n\nBurrow\nA monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.\n\nClimb\nA monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.\n\nFly\nA monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to\nhover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the Player’s Handbook). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.\n\nSwim\nA monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra movement to swim.\n\nAbility Scores\nEvery monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used in play, see the\nPlayer’s Handbook.\n\nSaving Throws\nThe Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.\nA saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).\n\nProficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating\nChallenge  Proficiency  Bonus  Challenge  Proficiency  Bonus  \n0          +2                  14         +5                  \n1/8        +2                  15         +5                  \n1/4        +2                  16         +5                  \n1/2        +2                  17         +6                  \n1          +2                  18         +6                  \n2          +2                  19         +6                  \n3          +2                  20         +6                  \n4          +2                  21         +7                  \n5          +3                  22         +7                  \n6          +3                  23         +7                  \n7          +3                  24         +7                  \n8          +3                  25         +8                  \n9          +4                  26         +8                  \n10         +4                  27         +8                  \n11         +4                  28         +8                  \n12         +4                  29         +9                  \n13         +5                  30         +9                  \n\n\nSkills\nThe Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\nA skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a\nmonster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.\n\nVulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities\nSome creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.\n\nSenses\nThe Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.\n\nBlindsight\nA monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.   Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.  If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.\n\nDarkvision\nA monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.\n\nArmor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies\nAssume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment. For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither. See the\nPlayer’s Handbook for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.\n\nTremorsense\nA monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many\nburrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.\n\nTruesight\nA monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.\n\nLanguages\nThe languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A “-” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.\n\nTelepathy\nTelepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.\nA telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.\nA creature within the area of an antimagic fieldor in any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t send or receive telepathic messages.\n\nChallenge\nA monster’s\nchallenge rating tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.  Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.  Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.\n\nExperience Points\nThe number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.  Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.\n\nExperience Points by Challenge Rating\nChallenge  XP       Challenge  XP       \n0          0 or 10  14         11,500   \n1/8        25       15         13,000   \n1/4        50       16         15,000   \n1/2        100      17         18,000   \n1          200      18         20,000   \n2          450      19         22,000   \n3          700      20         25,000   \n4          1,100    21         33,000   \n5          1,800    22         41,000   \n6          2,300    23         50,000   \n7          2,900    24         62,000   \n8          3,900    25         75,000   \n9          5,000    26         90,000   \n10         5,900    27         105,000  \n11         7,200    28         120,000  \n12         8,400    29         135,000  \n13         10,000   30         155,000  \n\n\nSpecial Traits\nSpecial traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.\n\nInnate Spellcasting\nA monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.\nAn innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the\nlevitatespell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.\nA monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells. If a monster’s innate spells don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.\n\nSpellcasting\nA monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as\nexplained in the\nPlayer’s Handbook). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.\nThe monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when at tuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.\nA monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level\nlightning boltspell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.\nYou can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.\n\nPsionics\nA monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.\n\nActions\nWhen a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the Player’s Handbook.\n\nMelee and Ranged Attacks\nThe most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the Player’s Handbook.\nCreature vs. Target. The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.\nHit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “Hit” notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.\nMiss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the “Miss:” notation.\n\nMultiattack\nA creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.\n\nAmmunition\nA monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.\n\nReactions\nIf a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.\n\nLimited Usage\nSome special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.\nX/Day.The notation “X/Day” means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.\nRecharge X-Y.The notation “Recharge X-Y” means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.\nFor example, “Recharge 5-6” means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.\nRecharge after a Short or Long Rest.This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.\n\nGrapple Rules for Monsters\nMany monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.\nA creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster’s stat block. If no\nescape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster’s Strength (Athletics) modifier.\n\nEquipment\nA stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.\nYou can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.  If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.\n\nLegendary Creatures\nA legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.  If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.\n\nLegendary Actions\nA legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions-called legendary actions-outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.\n\nA Legendary Creature’s Lair\nA legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.\n\nLair Actions\nIf a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.\n\nRegional Effects\nThe mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.\n"], "response": "**Size in D&D 5e**\n\n| Size | Typical *Space* (grid square) | Typical *Reach* | Notes |\n|------|------------------------------|-----------------|-------|\n| Tiny | 2.5 ft  | 2.5 ft | Very few monsters; often “tiny” goblins or pixies. |\n| Small | 5 ft | 5 ft | Most humanoid monsters (kobolds, goblins, gnolls). |\n| Medium | 5 ft | 5 ft | Normal human‑sized monsters (trolls, owlbears, giants’ kids). |\n| Large | 10 ft | 10 ft | Half‑size giants, otyughs, dragons’ hatchlings. |\n| Huge | 15 ft | 15 ft | Large dragons, gargoyles, many elemental giants. |\n| Gargantuan | 20 ft | 20 ft | Tarrasque, great wyrms, colossal constructs. |\n\n*(A “Colossal” size exists in DMG‑derived content but isn’t in the core PHB.)*\n\n---\n\n### 1.  How Size Works\n\n1. **Space** – On a 5 ft grid, a creature’s *space* is the square (or set of squares) it occupies.  \n   * Tiny → 2.5 ft square (often half a normal grid square).  \n   * Small/Medium → 5 ft square.  \n   * Large → 10 ft square (covers 4 grid squares).  \n   * Huge → 15 ft square (covers 9 grid squares).  \n   * Gargantuan → 20 ft square (covers 16 grid squares).  \n\n2. **Reach** – A creature’s reach is normally equal to its space, unless a weapon says otherwise.  \n   * Medium or Small → 5 ft reach.  \n   * Large → 10 ft reach.  \n   * Huge → 15 ft reach, etc.  \n\n3. **Movement** – The creature moves the amount its speed allows, but it can’t move through a space occupied by a creature of equal or larger size unless the rules (e.g., *grapple*) allow it.  \n\n4. **Grappling & Swarming** – A creature can occupy the same space as a creature one size larger (or any size if it’s a *swarm*). A grapple that ends in a space of a larger creature is usually “pushed” to a space of that larger creature, effectively moving the grappled creature to the larger creature’s space.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Monster Examples by Size\n\n| Size | Representative Monsters (PHB/Monster Manual) |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Tiny | **Pixie** (Tiny, 10 ft speed, fly 10 ft), **Giant Mouse** (Tiny, 30 ft speed) |\n| Small | **Goblin**, **Kobold**, **Gnoll** (all 30 ft speed, 5 ft space) |\n| Medium | **Owlbear**, **Troll**, **Basilisk** (5 ft space, 5 ft reach) |\n| Large | **Otyugh**, **Great Bear**, **Dragon Hatchling** (10 ft space, 10 ft reach) |\n| Huge | **Adult Red Dragon**, **Gargoyle**, **Gelatinous Cube** (15 ft space, 15 ft reach) |\n| Gargantuan | **Tarrasque**, **Great Wyrm** (20 ft space, 20 ft reach) |\n\n*(These are just a handful; many more monsters fit each category.)*\n\n---\n\n### 3.  How Size Affects the Space a Creature Controls in Combat\n\n1. **Blocking and Cover**  \n   * A Large creature occupies a 10 ft × 10 ft area, so it blocks two adjacent 5 ft squares and can provide cover to anything behind it.  \n   * A Huge or Gargantuan creature can block an entire 15 ft or 20 ft corridor, making it a powerful obstacle.\n\n2. **Line‑of‑Sight & Ranged Attacks**  \n   * Because a creature’s reach equals its size, a Large monster can strike from 10 ft away; a Huge from 15 ft.  \n   * When you line‑of‑sight a target, you must consider the target’s space—if you’re within 5 ft of a Medium creature, you’re already within its reach.\n\n3. **Movement & Positioning**  \n   * You cannot move a creature into a space that’s already occupied by a creature of equal or larger size (unless you’re *grappling* or have a special ability).  \n   * A Small or Tiny creature can slip into the space of a Medium creature, but a Medium creature cannot move into a Large creature’s space.\n\n4. **Combat Formations**  \n   * When you line up in a “line” or “column,” the spaces a creature occupies dictate how many can fit in a single row.  \n   * A 5 ft‑by‑5 ft square can hold only one Medium or Small creature; a 10 ft‑by‑10 ft square can hold one Large, two Medium (if they share the edge), etc.\n\n5. **Area‑of‑Effect (AoE) Spells**  \n   * Spells that affect a *square* or *radius* (e.g., fireball 20 ft radius) treat the target’s *space* as the center.  \n   * A Large creature occupies 4 squares; if the spell’s radius is 15 ft, all 4 squares may be hit.\n\n6. **Grapples & Shoving**  \n   * If you grapple a creature, you can move it to a space the grappled creature *could* occupy.  \n   * A Small creature grappled by a Large one can be shoved into the Large creature’s space, effectively “crowding” the Large creature.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Quick Reference\n\n| Size | Space | Reach | Example of Combat Impact |\n|------|-------|-------|--------------------------|\n| Tiny | 2.5 ft | 2.5 ft | Can hide in the spaces between Medium monsters; can step into a Medium creature’s space. |\n| Small | 5 ft | 5 ft | Occupies one grid square; can block a single line of movement. |\n| Medium | 5 ft | 5 ft | Same as Small in grid terms; can’t block more than one square unless multiple Mediums. |\n| Large | 10 ft | 10 ft | Blocks a 2 × 2 grid area; can provide cover to two adjacent squares. |\n| Huge | 15 ft | 15 ft | Blocks a 3 × 3 area; can fill a large corridor. |\n| Gargantuan | 20 ft | 20 ft | Occupies a 4 × 4 area; effectively the entire battlefield can be its space in a 20 ft square arena. |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Size dictates how many grid squares a creature fills, how far it can reach, and what spaces it can move into or block. Knowing a monster’s size lets you predict whether it can stand in a corridor, protect allies with its bulk, or make a melee attack that hits multiple foes at once.", "reference": "Size refers to the categories Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, and Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Tiny creatures occupy 2½ by 2½ feet of space and examples include an imp or sprite.

{"user_input": "How do sentient magic items function as NPCs under GM control?", "reference_contexts": ["Sentient Magic Items Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side. Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient. Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder."], "response": "**Sentient magic items as NPCs – quick‑reference guide**\n\n| What the DM needs to decide | Where the rules come from | Practical tip |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|\n| **Identity** (name, description, personality) | DMG p. 140–141 | Give the item a distinct voice and back‑story. |\n| **Alignment & goals** | DMG p. 140 | The item’s alignment may differ from its holder’s; its motivations can be independent (e.g., “I want to be wielded by a champion of the Sun”) or tied to the holder (e.g., “I’m bound to protect my owner”). |\n| **Stat block** | DMG p. 140 (template) | Treat it like any other NPC: AC, hit points, attacks, damage, saving‑throw DCs. Use the “Sentient Item” stat block unless the item’s special abilities require a custom one. |\n| **Actions & traits** | DMG p. 140 | An item may have its own **trait** (e.g., “Intelligence 18, Wisdom 16”) and **action** (e.g., “Smite” attack, spell‑casting, or item‑specific effect). Include any built‑in item features (like *Balm of the Firewalker*’s spell list). |\n| **Initiative** | DMG p. 140 | Decide if the item moves on its own or waits for the holder. Common rule: the item acts on the holder’s initiative if it’s in their possession; otherwise it has its own turn. |\n| **Interaction mechanics** | DMG p. 141 | Sentient items can speak, make Intimidate or Persuasion checks, or attempt to free themselves. Treat them as an NPC for skill checks (use the item’s stat block’s ability scores). |\n| **Damage and saving throws** | DMG p. 140 | Use the item’s hit points and AC. When the item is damaged, its “spell‑casting” or other special abilities may be reduced (DMG says “if the item takes damage, it may lose power”). |\n| **Binding / free will** | DMG p. 141 | Some items can be bound (e.g., *Sentinel’s Shield*), limiting who may use them. Others are fully free‑willing, which can lead to plot twists. |\n\n---\n\n### Step‑by‑step: Turning a sentient sword into an NPC\n\n1. **Choose the item** – e.g., *The Blade of Endless Vengeance* (sentient, good alignment, Int 18, Wis 15).  \n2. **Create its stat block**  \n   * AC 18, HP 45 (4d8 + 20), Speed 30 ft.  \n   * **Traits** – *Sentient (Int 18, Wis 15)*, *Can cast *smite* (1st‑level spell) as a bonus action when wielded by a creature of good alignment.*  \n   * **Actions** – *Attack:* +7 to hit, 1d8 + 4 slashing.  \n   * **Special** – *When the blade is held, it whispers suggestions (Persuasion check DC 15).*  \n3. **Decide on alignment & motives** – Good, wants to be wielded by a true hero, will resist a dark‑aligned user.  \n4. **Determine initiative rule** – If the blade is in the party’s inventory, it acts on the holder’s turn. If it’s loose on the floor, give it its own initiative.  \n5. **Interaction** –  \n   * The sword can initiate conversation; it may try to convince a party member to “be worthy.”  \n   * It can cast *Detect Evil* or *Detect Magic* at the holder’s request.  \n   * If a PC attempts to “free” it (say, via a *Break Enchantment*), it can make a DC 18 Intimidation check to resist.  \n6. **Gameplay loop** –  \n   * In combat: use the sword’s attack and *smite* ability.  \n   * Out of combat: use its Persuasion trait to influence decisions, or let it act on its own initiative to negotiate or warn the party.  \n   * In the narrative: the sword’s goals can drive quests (“Find the High King to be wielded by a true champion”).\n\n---\n\n### Quick NPC‑style handling checklist\n\n| Action | DM move | Player reaction |\n|--------|---------|-----------------|\n| **Encounter** | Roll initiative; treat the item as a monster if it acts independently. | PCs may choose to attack or bargain. |\n| **Skill checks** | Use the item’s ability scores for relevant checks (Int 18 for Arcana, Wis 15 for Insight). | PCs can negotiate or try to manipulate the item. |\n| **Combat abilities** | Use the item’s stat block attacks and special actions. | PCs may try to use the item’s abilities against it (e.g., *Disarm* or *Dismantle*). |\n| **Freeing/Binding** | Apply the item’s rules for breaking or binding (DMG p. 141). | PCs may attempt to use *Break Enchantment* or similar spells. |\n\n---\n\n### Things to watch for\n\n- **Balance:** Sentient items can be powerful. Scale their stat block to the party’s level; if the item is a 20‑level sword, it may be a mid‑level boss for a party of 4–5 20‑level PCs.  \n- **Motivation conflicts:** If an item’s goals clash with a PC’s (e.g., a good item hates a warlock), this can lead to rich drama but may also create role‑playing friction.  \n- **Story continuity:** Use the item’s personality consistently. If it’s said to be “wise,” let it make smart choices.  \n- **Endgame:** Decide if the item’s story arc ends (it dies, is destroyed, or achieves its goal).  \n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Treat a sentient magic item like any other NPC: give it a stat block, alignment, personality, and a set of actions/traits, then run it using the standard NPC rules.

{"user_input": "What is a sentient item's Special purpose?", "reference_contexts": ["Creating Sentient Magic Items When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here. Abilities A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest. Communication A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table. d100 Communication 01-60 The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it. 61-90 The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. 91-00 The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it. Senses With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table. d4 Senses 1 Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet. 2 Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet 3 Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet. 4 Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet. Alignment A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table. d100 Alignment d100 Alignment 01 - 15 Lawful good 74 - 85 Chaotic neutral 16 - 35 Neutral good 86 - 89 Lawful evil 36 - 50 Chaotic good 90 - 96 Neutral evil 51 - 63 Lawful neutral 97 - 00 Chaotic evil 64 - 73 Neutral Special Purpose You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following table. d10 Purpose 1 Aligned: The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is never neutral.) 2 Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or wizards. 3 Pro tector: The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind of creature, such as elves or druids. 4 Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the servants of a particular deity. 5 Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and interests o f a particular deity. 6 Destroyer: The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily. 7 Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious figure. 8 Lore Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy. 9 Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events. 10 Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created. Conflict A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands: •The item insists on being carried or worn at all times. •The item demands that its wielder dispose ofanything the item finds repugnant. •The item demands that its wielder pursue theitem’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals. •The item demands to be given to someone else.If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’swishes, the item can do any or all of the following: •Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it. •Suppress one or more of its activated properties. •Attempt to take control of its wielder.If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn."], "response": "In 5e the line **“Special Purpose”** appears on the description of every magic item (including sentient ones).  \nIt simply tells you what the item is meant to be used for – i.e. its *type*.

{"user_input": "tell me how fear spell works and what it do in story world, and how it can be used for drama?", "reference_contexts": ["The Schools of Magic Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity. The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools. Abjurationspells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence. Conjurationspells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing. Divinationspells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places. Enchantmentspells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet. Evocationspells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds. Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature. Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life. Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently. Transmutation spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury. Combining Magical Effects The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect-such as the highest bonus-from those castings applies while their durations overlap. For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.

On a fail, the creature becomes **frightened** for 1 min. |\n| **Cause Fear** (XGtE) | 4th | Common | 60 ft | 1 creature | 1 min (no concentration) | Same effect as *Fear* but single‑target. |\n| **Banishment** (PHB) | 4th | Common | 60 ft | 1 creature | 1 min (or until the spell ends) | Can cause a creature to become frightened while it’s being banished. |\n| **Intimidating Presence** (PHB) | 2nd | Common | 30 ft | 1 creature | 1 day | No save – a creature must make a Wisdom save or become frightened for 1 day. |\n| **Heroism** (PHB) | 1st | Common | Touch | 1 creature | 1 h | Grants temporary HP; the target also gets **fear immunity**. |\n\n> **Frightened Condition (PHB, p. 287)**\n> * A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.  \n> * It must use a bonus action on each of its turns to move as far as possible away from the source.  \n> * If it can’t move, it can use its reaction to try to escape (but it can’t attack).  \n> * A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.\n\n**Key take‑away:** The spell doesn’t kill or damage; it makes characters *panic* and *flank* or *flee*, and it gives the caster a strategic advantage (e.g., a frightened party member is a loose cannon).\n\n---\n\n### Narrative Impact in the World\n\n1. **Atmosphere & Tone**  \n   - *Fear* instantly turns a tense dungeon crawl into a scream‑filled nightmare. The sound of rattling chains, the growl of unseen beasts, the looming presence of a dreadlord—all are amplified.  \n   - In a story set in a plague‑ridden town, a spell of fear can cause citizens to barricade themselves, leading to social chaos.\n\n2. **Character Development**  \n   - Heroes who are normally stoic may show cracks; a once‑unflappable wizard might stumble in a frightened moment.  \n   - Villains who revel in terror can revel in the chaos they create, showing their true nature.\n\n3. **Plot Device**  \n   - A *Fear* spell can force a party to split—some flee, some stay to rescue a trapped ally, others seek a safe way out.  \n   - An NPC might become frightened of a certain location, creating a quest hook: “Can you help me overcome my fear?”  \n\n4. **Worldbuilding**  \n   - Cultures may revere or fear the use of such spells. A kingdom that bans fear‑spells becomes a sanctuary; a warlord who commands fear is feared.\n\n---\n\n### Using Fear for Drama\n\n| Situation | How Fear Enhances Drama | Example |\n|-----------|------------------------|---------|\n| **Ambush / Trap** | Creates instant panic, causing the party to make rushed decisions that can backfire. | In a collapsing hallway, a *Fear* spell from a hidden pit triggers, sending the party into a frantic dash. |\n| **Leadership Test** | A commander’s fear reveals their true leadership quality. | The captain of a merchant convoy is frightened; the players must decide whether to follow them or assume command. |\n| **Romantic/Personal Stakes** | A loved one’s fear can force a character to act. | The hero’s child is frightened by a cursed item; the hero must risk a dangerous encounter to save them. |\n| **Moral Dilemmas** | Characters must decide whether to exploit fear or help the frightened. | A necromancer’s spell turns the party frightened; the DM asks if the party should try to help or flee. |\n| **Narrative Tension** | Builds anticipation for the reveal of the threat. | Players see a shadowy figure; a *Fear* spell hits, making them flee into a dark corridor, raising the stakes. |\n| **Psychological Thriller** | Adds layers to an otherwise straightforward combat. | A mind‑controlling wizard casts *Fear* and then manipulates the frightened creatures into attacking each other. |\n\n**Practical Tips for DM & Players**\n\n1. **Set the Scene** – Describe how the fear feels: “Your stomach drops, your heartbeat pounds, every shadow seems to whisper doom.”  \n2. **Use the Condition Rules** – Show the effect clearly: “You must move away (use your bonus action). You cannot attack.”  \n3. **Let the Crowd React** – NPCs should act frightened; crowds might stampede, guards might flee, townsfolk might barricade.  \n4. **Give Them a Chance** – Allow the frightened creature to save each turn. Success can mean a heroic moment (a wizard breaking free from a curse).  \n5. **Tie to Story Beats** – Use fear to make the players make a crucial decision or to propel the plot forward.  \n\n---\n\n### Sample Dramatic Moment\n\n> **Scene:** The party enters the ruined temple of the Forgotten Mother. The air is thick with dust. A sudden low growl reverberates through the halls.  \n> **DM:** “A tremor shakes the floor, and a ripple of dark mist rushes toward you. *Fear*—the whispering voice booms: ‘Turn back, mortals.’”  \n> **Result:** All party members must make a Wisdom save. Two succeed, staying calm. The other four fail and become frightened.  \n> **Drama:**  \n> * The wounded ranger, normally stoic, starts to stagger, forcing the group to split.  \n> * The wizard, frightened, drops their spellbook, risking a spell‑casting mishap.  \n> * The rogue decides to stay and shield the frightened allies, risking an ambush.  \n> * The DM can reveal that the mist is the mother’s guardian, now enraged and about to unleash a curse.  \n> * Players must choose: flee with a wounded ally or fight a terror that threatens everyone.  \n\nThis scene turns a simple exploration into an emotional, character‑driven decision, showcasing how a fear spell can powerfully drive drama.", "reference": "Fear is a spell mentioned in the list of spells.

{"user_input": "What happens when a goristro demon is targeted by the Maze spell?", "reference_contexts": ["Maze 8th-level conjuration Casting Time:1 action Range:60 feet Components:V, S Duration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze. The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds). When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space. Meld into Stone 3rd-level transmutation (ritual) Casting Time:1 action Range:Touch Components:V, S Duration:8 hoursYou step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses. While merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can’t move. Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered. Mending Transmutation cantrip Casting Time: 1 minute Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (two lodestones) Duration: Instantaneous This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object. Message Transmutation cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire) Duration: 1 round You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear. You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings."], "response": "**Short answer:**  \nA goristro demon can be targeted by *maze* just like any other creature. The spell sends the goristro into a labyrinthine demiplane; while inside it can’t affect the world, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns to escape. Nothing about the goristro’s particular abilities (e.g., its “Permanently Teleports” trait) lets it break free on its own.  \n\n---\n\n### What the spell actually says\n\n*Maze* (PHB 282)  \n> *You banish the target creature into a labyrinthine demiplane. While in the maze, the creature can’t affect the world. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns or it returns to the space it occupied when the spell was cast.*\n\nKey points for a goristro:\n\n| Item | Effect on the goristro |\n|------|------------------------|\n| **Target type** | Any creature. The goristro is a *fiend, demon* and is therefore a valid target. |\n| **Plane** | The goristro is normally on the Material Plane (or wherever it was summoned). The spell works on a creature that is on the same plane as the caster. |\n| **Action/Bonus Action** | The spell does *not* grant the creature a way to escape other than the Wisdom save. The goristro’s teleportation ability is a *move* that affects the world, so it can’t use that to leave the maze. |\n| **Wisdom save** | The goristro must roll a Wisdom save at the end of each of its turns. The goristro’s Wisdom score (16, +3) gives it a +5 to the save (PHB 288). It is not immune to the spell. |\n\n### Why no special interaction occurs\n\n* **No rule exempts demons from *maze*.** The spell’s description doesn’t list fiends as immune or exempt.  \n* **Teleportation doesn’t bypass the spell.** The text explicitly says the creature can’t affect the world while in the maze, and teleportation is an effect that moves the creature, so the goristro can’t use its “Permanently Teleports” trait to escape.  \n* **The goristro’s other traits are irrelevant.** Traits like “Permanently Teleports” or “Mortal's Scream” are simply ignored while the creature is trapped, because the spell prevents it from affecting the world in any way.  \n\n### Bottom line\n\nWhen you cast *maze* on a goristro, it is sent to the labyrinthine demiplane, cannot use any of its abilities to affect the world (including teleportation), and must make a Wisdom save each turn to get back. There’s no special rule that treats the goristro differently; it’s subject to *maze* exactly like any other creature.", "reference": "When a goristro demon is targeted by the Maze spell, it automatically succeeds on the DC 20 Intelligence check to escape, and the spell ends.", "answer_relevancy": 0.9333653870882476, "semantic_similarity": 0.34386713701697924, "bleu_score": 0.03719201063379081, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.07126948775055679, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.03773584905660377, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.64}

The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

The terrain’s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately. Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion. Mirror Image 2nd-level illusion Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S Duration: 1 minute Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates. Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates. If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher. A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

The spell lets you mimic *any* sound you could normally make—a door slam, a child’s laugh, a wind gust, a dragon’s roar, etc.  \n3. **Cast the spell**. The sound immediately begins and lasts for the spell’s 1‑minute duration.  \n4. **All listeners within 5 ft** of the point hear the illusionary sound. If someone is 6 ft away, they don’t.  \n5. **Repeat or refresh**:  \n   * The spell doesn’t require concentration, so you can cast it again on a different point or the same point at any time.  \n   * If you want a continuous, uninterrupted sound that lasts longer than a minute, you must recast the spell each minute (or cast it again before the first one ends).  \n\n---\n\n### Key Limitations\n\n| Limitation | What it means |\n|------------|---------------|\n| **Only one effect per casting** | You can’t simultaneously create an image *and* a sound; choose one. |\n| **5‑ft audible radius** | The illusionary sound is only heard within 5 ft of the chosen point. To cover a larger area you need multiple castings at different points. |\n| **Duration** | The sound lasts exactly 1 min unless you dismiss it or it’s overwritten. |\n| **Plausibility** | While the rules don’t forbid any sound, the DM may rule that the sound must be something you could plausibly produce. For example, a 300‑ft distant thunderclap might be “too big” for a single caster’s illusion. |\n| **No physical effect** | It doesn’t create actual sound waves that can damage, break objects, or move items. It’s purely a sensory deception. |\n| **No concentration** | The spell never fades if you take damage or are distracted, but you can’t use the “duration” to create a sound that keeps going forever. |\n\n---\n\n### Practical Tips & Common Uses\n\n- **Distraction or deception**: A door slam can mask your footsteps, or a siren can divert guards.  \n- **Covering up actions**: A clanging metal sound can hide the scrape of a sword.  \n- **Simulating a presence**: A distant laugh can make a party think someone else is nearby.  \n- **Audio camouflage**: Create a faint wind to mask the sound of a spell that requires verbal components.  \n- **Creating ambience**: Cast it at the start of a room to give the illusion of a campfire’s crackle, then recast every minute to keep it going.\n\n---\n\n### What the DM Might Ask\n\n- *“What is the exact sound?”* – You describe it (e.g., “a booming, metallic clang”).  \n- *“Is it realistic for a 2‑ft‑wide spell to make a dragon’s roar?”* – The DM can say yes if it’s believable, or ask for a more modest sound.  \n- *“Will it reach the enemy 30 ft away?”* – No; the 5‑ft limit stands.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nTo make sound with *Minor Illusion*, choose a point within 120 ft, pick any plausible sound, cast the spell, and the illusionary noise will last for 1 minute, audible only to those within 5 ft of that point.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event. You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends. A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream.

Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spell’s light. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction. At Higher Levels.

You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect. Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement. This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain.

If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level). Moonbeam 2nd-level evocation Casting Time:1 action Range:120 feet Components:V, S, M (several seeds of any moon seed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar) Duration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteA silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spell’s light. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd. Move Earth 6th-level transmutation Casting Time:1 action Range:120 feet Components:V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils-clay, loam, and sand) Duration:Concentration, up to 2 hoursChoose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect. Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement. This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse. Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it. Nondetection 3rd-level abjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25 gp sprinkled over the target, which the spell consumes) Duration: 8 hours For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can’t be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. Pass without Trace 2nd-level abjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage. Passwall 5th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range:30 feet Components:V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds) Duration:1 hourA passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You"], "response": "**Quick note:** “Memery mod spel” is probably a typo for *memory‑modifying spell*.  \nBelow is a framework you can adapt whether you’re using an official spell (e.g., **Forget**, **Alter Memory** from *Strixhaven* or *Spelljammer*) or a home‑brew spell you’re inventing.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. How to Use the Spell Narratively\n\n| Goal | Mechanical Hook | Story Hook |\n|------|-----------------|------------|\n| **Erase a traumatic event** | Target: creature (any level) – you “erase” one memory. | The party uncovers a village cursed by a forgotten war. The spell lets them learn what was lost. |\n| **Create a new memory** | Target: creature – you insert a fabricated memory. | An antagonist plants a false hero myth in the hero’s mind, making the party question their past. |\n| **Remove a campaign‑level plot thread** | Target: group or object (e.g., an artifact that holds collective memory). | The spell wipes the world’s knowledge of the *Rift of Ages*, allowing you to re‑introduce it later. |\n| **Add flavor to a setting** | Spell level: 2–4. Casting time: 1 minute. | In a city of chroniclers, the spell is a forbidden rite used by the “Archivists’ Guild” to erase inconvenient truths. |\n\n### Practical Tips\n\n1. **Choose the *type* of memory change**  \n   - *Erase:* Removes a memory permanently.  \n   - *Replace:* Swaps an old memory for a new one.  \n   - *Add:* Leaves the old memory, but adds a new one (useful for subtle manipulation).\n\n2. **Limit scope** – The DMG’s *Alter Memory* rule suggests a target’s memories are *non‑volatile* (you can’t just wipe the entire mind). A single event or a small cluster (e.g., the day of a betrayal) is more narratively plausible than “all memories of the first moon.”  \n\n3. **Introduce a *narrative cost*** –  \n   - *High risk:* The spell may backfire, leaving the target confused or hostile.  \n   - *High resource cost:* Long casting time, expensive components, or a limited number of uses per day.  \n\n4. **Use the spell as a plot device, not a cheat sheet** – Let the spell trigger a quest or moral dilemma. For example, if the party erases the memory of a city’s massacre, the city might not know it was saved, and the people’s gratitude is lost.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the GM Might Think of “Nonsensical” Use\n\n| Scenario | Why it’s *nonsensical* | GM’s possible reaction |\n|----------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| **Erasing a memory that the character never remembered** | No knowledge = no memory. | GM may say “this is impossible” or “the spell has no effect.” |\n| **Changing a memory to something *completely unrelated* to the character’s experience** | The spell is about *modifying* what the character *already has*. | GM might allow it but give it a *higher DC* or a *penalty* (e.g., the character is stunned while their mind reorganizes). |\n| **Using the spell on a creature whose memories are *locked* by a deity or artifact** | Some creatures (e.g., *Elder Brain*, *Mind Flayers*) have *mind‑protective* powers. | GM may treat it as “no effect” or “the spell triggers a curse.” |\n| **Erasing all memories of a major world event (e.g., the Great Cataclysm)** | That event is woven into world lore, many creatures remember it, and its effects still exist. | GM might impose a *world‑wide side effect* (e.g., the sky turns gray, a lingering curse). |\n\n**Rule of thumb:** The GM will weigh *logic* + *balance*. If the spell’s effect feels “magical cheat” rather than a *story‑driving twist*, they may deem it too nonsensical to affect a creature significantly.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Incorporating the Spell into Campaign Lore\n\n| Lore Element | Spell Integration Idea |\n|--------------|------------------------|\n| **Ancient Guild of Archivists** | Their *Secret of Remembering* spell erases only “undesirable” memories, but the guild secretly uses it to rewrite history. |\n| **Forgotten Deity of Forgetting** | The deity’s favor grants a “blessing of oblivion” – a spell that can erase a specific event. |\n| **Cursed Artifact** | A relic that “remembers” itself and can wipe a city’s collective memory if it’s activated. |\n| **The Hall of Echoes** | A temple where all past heroes’ memories are stored. The spell can selectively pull or erase these echoes. |\n\n**How to make it fit:**  \n- Provide a *source book* or *ancient scroll* that explains the spell’s origin.  \n- Tie the spell’s limits to a myth (e.g., “You cannot erase what the gods themselves remember”).  \n- Give the spell an *associated cost* (a soul fragment, a lost loved one’s memory).  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Creative Uses to Enhance the Setting\n\n| Use | Effect on World | Example Hook |\n|-----|-----------------|--------------|\n| **Redaction of a Dark Pact** | Entire kingdoms forget a pact with demons. | The party stumbles on an ancient treaty that mentions *“the night the dragons awoke.”* |\n| **Fabricating a Hero’s Legend** | A cult spreads false memories of a deity’s sacrifice. | The party must prove the real story or risk being turned into pawns. |\n| **Permanent Eradication of a Memory Cluster** | Erases an entire city’s *shared trauma*, leading to a sudden, unexplained peace. | The city’s citizens act oddly, prompting the party to investigate. |\n| **Creating “Echoes”** | You can plant a *false* memory that manifests as a recurring dream for the party. | The party dreams of a lost city; each dream contains a clue. |\n\n**Balancing Tips**  \n- **Limited attempts:** One use per long rest, or a single use per campaign chapter.  \n- **Consequences:** Each successful use draws the caster’s sanity or attracts the attention of a *Memory‑Keeper* NPC.  \n- **Narrative checks:** Require a *DC* that rises with the significance of the memory (e.g., erase a major world event = DC 20+).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Using the Spell “Mechanically Sound and Narratively Rich”\n\n1. **Spell Definition (Sample Home‑brew)**  \n   - **Name:** *Altered Recall*  \n   - **Level:** 3rd (or 2nd if you want it lighter)  \n   - **Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n   - **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of parchment that contains the target’s memory)  \n   - **Range:** 30 ft. (touch)  \n   - **Duration:** Instantaneous  \n   - **Effect:** Choose one of the following:  \n     - **Erase**: Remove one specific memory (a single event).  \n     - **Replace**: Swap that memory for a new one of equal length.  \n     - **Add**: Insert a new memory while the old remains (useful for manipulation).  \n\n2. **Skill Checks**  \n   - **To Erase/Replace/Add a memory that is *well‑known* (e.g., a major event), the caster must make an *Arcana* check against DC 15 + the target’s *Insight* bonus.  \n   - **If the target resists (e.g., has *Mind Blank* or a *magical shield*), the check is made against a higher DC (20).**\n\n3. **Narrative Hooks**  \n   - **The Party’s Own Memories:** The spell could be used by a character’s friend to erase their trauma, but the friend later realizes the party’s true self is hidden behind a fabricated memory.  \n   - **World‑Changing Event:** Erasing a city’s memory of a disaster may allow the city to prosper, but the *ghosts* of the forgotten people haunt the streets.  \n   - **Moral Dilemma:** The party must decide whether to erase a villain’s memory of their family (making them less dangerous) or keep the truth to prevent future manipulation.\n\n4. **Long‑Term Effects**  \n   - **Permanent Eradication** is possible but costly: *Consume a memory shard* (a rare item) and spend a *full day of meditation* before the spell can be cast.  \n   - **Create a New Memory of an Event**: The new memory can be a *tale* (e.g., “the hero who saved the realm”) that will spread through oral tradition, altering how NPCs view the party.\n\n---\n\n## 6. GM’s Perspective on “Too Nonsensical”\n\n| Indicator | Action |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **The spell erases a memory that has *no* narrative presence** | Likely “no effect” or *re‑roll* with a penalty. |\n| **The spell changes a memory in a way that violates a *world rule* (e.g., a memory of a god that is literally immortal)** | GM may require a *higher DC* or *penalty* (the target is stunned, the spell backfires). |\n| **The spell tries to erase *all* memories of a fundamental event (e.g., the entire history of a realm)** | GM may treat it as *world‑changing*, giving the spell an *Epic* impact (e.g., the spell’s failure causes a reality shift). |\n\n**How to keep it fun:**  \n- Use the spell as a *tool* that reveals hidden truths or creates *tension* rather than a *cure‑all.*  \n- Keep the *limitations* clear in the campaign.  \n- Allow the spell to *trigger* side quests: “You’ve erased the memory of the River’s Pact—now the River spirits need your help to remember.”\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n1. **Define the spell’s limits** (what can and can’t be erased or added).  \n2. **Tie the spell to your lore** (ancient guild, deity, artifact).  \n3. **Balance mechanics** with narrative weight (DCs, resource costs, side effects).  \n4. **Let the GM decide “nonsense”** by checking against logic, balance, and story impact.  \n5. **Use the spell as a narrative hook** that forces the party to confront what they *do* and *do not* remember.  \n\nFeel free to tweak the rules to suit your campaign’s tone—whether you want a light, comedic twist or a weighty, world‑shaping decision. Happy storytelling!", "reference": "According to the spell description, the caster can permanently eliminate all memory of an event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity, change the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event. The spell requires the caster to speak to the target and the target must understand the language for the memory changes to take root. The target is charmed, incapacitated, and unaware of surroundings, but can still hear. The spell ends if the target takes damage or is targeted by another spell, and if the spell ends before the caster finishes describing the memory changes, the target’s memory is not altered. If the spell ends after the description, the modified memories take hold. A modified memory does not necessarily affect the creature’s behavior, especially if it contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical or nonsensical memory, such as one that says the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed and may be deemed too nonsensical by the GM to affect the creature significantly. A remove curse or greater restoration spell restores the creature’s true memory. At higher levels, the spell can alter memories of events up to 7 days (6th level), 30 days (7th level), 1 year (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).", "answer_relevancy": 0.5715425494416934, "semantic_similarity": 0.3451830061656608, "bleu_score": 0.028629993657668874, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.10350981558596074, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.059752747252747256, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.38666666666666666}

You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.  Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.  You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.\n\nPlant Growth\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action or 8 hours\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.  If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.  You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area from being affected.  If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.\n\nPoison Spray\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:10 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.\nThis spell's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).\n\nPolymorph\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 hourThis spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n\nPower Word Kill\n9th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.\n\nPower Word Stun\n8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.  The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.\n\nPrayer of Healing\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\n\nPrestidigitation\nTransmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Up to 1 hour This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:\n•You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind,faint musical notes, or an odd odor.\n•You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.\n•You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.\n•You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.\n•You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.\n•You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\n\nPrismatic Spray\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self (60-foot cone)\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousEight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.\n1.Red.The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n2.Orange.The target takes 10d6 acid damage ona failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n3.Yellow.The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n4.Green.The target takes 10d6 poison damage ona failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n5.Blue.The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n6.Indigo.On a failed save, the target is restrained.It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.\n7.Violet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. Itmust then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)\n8.Special. The target is struck by two rays. Rolltwice more, rerolling any 8.\n\nPrismatic Wall\n9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick-centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.  The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.  The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.  The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.\n1.Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\n2.Orange.The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer\nis destroyed by a strong wind.\n3.Yellow.The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n4.Green.The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A\npasswallspell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\n5.Blue.The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n6.Indigo.On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.\nIf it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\nWhile this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a\ndaylightspell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\n7.Violet.On a failed save, the creature is blinded.It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a\ndispel magicspell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.\n\nPrivate Sanctum\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time:10 minutes\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)\nDuration:24 hours\nYou make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.  When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:\n•Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge ofthe warded area.\n•The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision)through it.\n•Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.\n•Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.\n•Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.\n•Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.Casting this spell on the same spot every day for ayear makes this effect permanent.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.\n\nProduce Flame\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.  You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.  This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\n\nProgrammed Illusion\n6th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration:Until dispelledYou create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.\nWhen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.\nThe triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them.

The spell can be cast any number of times in a session (you’re not limited by spell slots). Here’s how it works and a quick recipe for using it in your story.\n\n---\n\n### Spell Basics\n\n| Feature | What it does |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **School** | Transmutation |\n| **Casting time** | 1 action |\n| **Range** | 10 ft (you can affect objects or yourself) |\n| **Components** | V, S |\n| **Duration** | 1 hour (for effects that last; otherwise instantaneous) |\n| **Key Limitations** | - Only minor, non‑destructive effects.<br>- No damage, no control over creatures.<br>- Effects can’t be cast on a creature that can’t be touched or observed. |\n\nThe spell text gives a list of **twelve possible effects**. You can choose any combination (up to the listed limits) each time you cast it. The effects are all “small”—e.g., a puff of glitter, a change of color, a scent, a minor taste alteration. The spell also lets you “clean” or “dull” an object, or create a “small, harmless sensory effect.”\n\n---\n\n### Quick Trick Ideas\n\nBelow are some of the most fun or plot‑useful ways to employ Prestidigitation. Use them as inspiration or mix them together.\n\n| Trick | How to Use It | Narrative Hook |\n|-------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Make a candle flicker** | Cast to light a candle without flame (no fire hazard). | A torchlit corridor becomes brighter when the party needs to read a map. |\n| **Flavor‑change a drink** | Alter the taste of a goblet so it tastes like honey. | A tavern’s “dangerous” ale turns sweet, hinting the bartender’s ulterior motive. |\n| **Dull a knife** | Remove shine so it appears dull. | The protagonist’s sword “scratches” the guard’s eye, giving the illusion of being weak. |\n| **Clean a dirty cloak** | Instantaneous wipe‑away. | The rogue slips past a guard without being noticed because his cloak is spotless. |\n| **Create a subtle scent** | Release a pleasant aroma (e.g., rosemary). | A thief uses the scent to mask the smell of their footprints. |\n| **Make a small object appear** | Animate a feather to flutter or a coin to hover. | The bard distracts guards by making a coin drift into the air. |\n| **Change the color of an object** | Turn a green rope red. | The party marks a path on a map with a red rope instead of a chalk line. |\n| **Produce a puff of harmless smoke** | Create a thin, non‑threatening cloud. | The wizard hides a small item in a puff of smoke to trick a guard. |\n| **Create a “tiny” sound** | Emit a faint ringing or whisper. | A monk uses it to signal teammates across a noisy tavern. |\n| **Set a piece of food alight with a gentle glow** | Light it as if with a candle. | The cook illuminates a pastry before serving it to the king. |\n| **Make a small object “glow”** | Give a gem a soft light. | The party finds a glowing map in a dark cave. |\n\n---\n\n### How It Works in the Story\n\n1. **Subtlety** – The spell’s effects are always small, so they’re easy to hide. A character can pretend it’s just a trick or a natural phenomenon.  \n2. **Versatility** – Because the spell lets you pick any combination, you can chain several tricks together: clean a cloak, change a coin’s color, and make a puff of smoke all in one turn.  \n3. **Time‑bound** – Anything lasting more than a moment fades after an hour. In a narrative, you can set up a “race against the clock” where the party must use a glowing map before the light fades.  \n4. **No cost** – As a cantrip, the spell doesn’t drain spell slots, so a low‑level caster can keep using it throughout an adventure.  \n5. **Narrative Flavor** – Use it to reveal character traits: a mischievous rogue loves the “make‑coins‑hover” trick, while a priest might use the “clean‑cloak” to keep holy garments pristine.\n\n---\n\n### Example Scene\n\n*The group enters the candle‑lit library. The candles are all guttering. The wizard casts Prestidigitation, lighting the candles with a gentle, invisible flame. As the light steadies, the bard casts the “small sound” effect to whisper “Secret door—turn right.” The rogue, having cleaned his gloves and changed a silver cuff to a gleaming gold one, slips past the watchful librarian who thinks nothing is amiss.*\n\nThis blend of visual flair and practical utility can make Prestidigitation a powerful, low‑stakes tool in any D&D story. Use it for comic relief, stealth, or subtle plot twists—its charm lies in the little things.", "reference": "Prestidigitation is a transmutation cantrip that lets you create minor magical effects within 10 feet.

You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.  Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.  You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.\n\nPlant Growth\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action or 8 hours\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.  If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.  You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area from being affected.  If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.\n\nPoison Spray\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:10 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.\nThis spell's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).\n\nPolymorph\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 hourThis spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n\nPower Word Kill\n9th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly.

Otherwise, the spell has no effect.\n\nPower Word Stun\n8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.  The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.\n\nPrayer of Healing\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.\n\nPrestidigitation\nTransmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Up to 1 hour This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:\n•You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind,faint musical notes, or an odd odor.\n•You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.\n•You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.\n•You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.\n•You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.\n•You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\n\nPrismatic Spray\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self (60-foot cone)\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousEight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.\n1.Red.The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n2.Orange.The target takes 10d6 acid damage ona failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n3.Yellow.The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n4.Green.The target takes 10d6 poison damage ona failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n5.Blue.The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n6.Indigo.On a failed save, the target is restrained.It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.\n7.Violet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. Itmust then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)\n8.Special. The target is struck by two rays. Rolltwice more, rerolling any 8.\n\nPrismatic Wall\n9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall-up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick-centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.  The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.  The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.  The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.\n1.Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\n2.Orange.The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The layer\nis destroyed by a strong wind.\n3.Yellow.The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n4.Green.The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A\npasswallspell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\n5.Blue.The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n6.Indigo.On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.\nIf it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\nWhile this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a\ndaylightspell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\n7.Violet.On a failed save, the creature is blinded.It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a\ndispel magicspell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.\n\nPrivate Sanctum\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time:10 minutes\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)\nDuration:24 hours\nYou make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.  When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:\n•Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge ofthe warded area.\n•The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision)through it.\n•Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.\n•Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.\n•Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.\n•Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.Casting this spell on the same spot every day for ayear makes this effect permanent.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.\n\nProduce Flame\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.  You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.  This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\n\nProgrammed Illusion\n6th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration:Until dispelledYou create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.\nWhen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.\nThe triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.\n\nProject Image\n7th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:500 miles\nComponents:V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 dayYou create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.\nYou can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.  You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.  Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.\n\nProtection from Poison\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:1 hourYou touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.\nFor the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.\n\nPurify Food and Drink\n1st-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:10 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousAll nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free of poison and disease.\n\nRaise Dead\n5th-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 hour\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:InstantaneousYou return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.\nThis spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead creature to life.\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival-its head, for instance-the spell automatically fails.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal.

The spell does not bring back any magical items or effects that were inside the body (e.g., a sword buried with it). |\n\n---\n\n### How to use it\n\n1. **Locate the body** of the creature that died ≤ 10 days ago.  \n2. **Make sure the body is present** on the same plane of existence as the caster.  \n3. **Cast Raise Dead** (spend the 500 gp diamond, spend 1 hour).  \n4.

The spell does **not** magically create or restore missing body parts.\n\n---\n\n### Missing body parts\n\n- **No replacement**: If a limb or head is missing, the creature remains without it.  \n- **Abilities tied to the missing part**: Any ability that relies on the missing part is unusable (e.g., a creature that lost its left hand can’t hold a weapon in that hand).  \n- **Stat changes**: The DM may decide that missing parts reduce relevant ability scores (e.g., a missing hand might lower Dexterity for tasks requiring both hands).  \n- **Long‑term loss**: The missing part stays gone until another method restores it (e.g., a *Limb* spell, a magical item, a prosthetic, or a divine blessing).  \n\n**Example**  \nA dwarf fighter died with his right arm severed. After you cast Raise Dead, the dwarf comes back with 1 HP restored, but he still lacks his right arm and cannot use it to hold a weapon or shield in that hand. He can still use his left arm normally.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reference\n\n| Situation | Raise Dead outcome |\n|-----------|--------------------|\n| Body intact | Creature fully healed |\n| Body missing a limb | Creature returned with that limb missing |\n| Body lost entirely | Spell fails (you need a body) |\n| Creature died >10 days ago | Spell cannot be used |\n\nThat’s all there is to it.

You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.

You choose the direction, so you can hit up to three 5‑ft‑wide enemies that line up in that cone (or one larger creature that fills the cone).  \n   *Line of sight* is required for the spell to affect a creature; a solid wall blocks it, but a fog or a thin curtain does not.\n\n2. **Saving throw** – Each creature in the cone must make a **Constitution save**.  \n   *Advantage/Disadvantage*: The spell itself does **not** grant advantage or disadvantage on the save, but a creature’s conditions or feats might.  \n   *Poison‑immune* creatures take no damage; *poison‑resistant* creatures take half (rounded down).  \n   *Poison‑dazed* or *poisoned* status has no effect on the save.\n\n3. **Damage** – A failed save deals the full damage dice listed above.  \n   A successful save deals **no** damage.  \n   The damage is pure poison; it does not trigger the *poisoned* condition on the target (that is a separate effect that some poisons or weapons apply).\n\n4. **No lingering effect** – The spell is instantaneous; there is no concentration, no duration, and no “poison cloud” that persists.  \n   If you want a lasting effect, you need another spell or a poisoned weapon.\n\n---\n\n### Veteran‑caster nuances\n\n| Point | Why it matters |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **Scaling** | The spell scales at 5th, 11th, and 17th level. At 17th lvl you can splash **4d12** poison damage in a 5‑ft cone – a single blast that can cut a party in half if the DC is low. |\n| **No spell‑attack** | Poison Spray is a save‑based cantrip; you never roll an attack roll. This means it’s immune to abilities that affect spell‑attack rolls (e.g., *Metamagic: Quickened Spell* for a sorcerer) and also means you can’t use a feature that requires a hit (like *Poisoned Weapon*). |\n| **Material component** | The “D” component is a small pinch of salt. It costs nothing and never depletes, but a DM might rule that the spell needs a pinch of salt if the caster has no access to it (e.g., in a desert). |\n| **Line‑of‑sight rules** | Unlike a spell that creates a cloud or a fireball that spreads, Poison Spray’s cone must be directly aimed. A DM can rule that wind can push the cone, but most rules treat it as a straight 5‑ft cone from the caster. |\n| **Combining with other effects** | You can’t twin or target a single creature, and you can’t use *Metamagic* on it (except for *Quickened Spell*, which turns it into a bonus action, but that’s rarely useful because the spell is 1 action). However, you can pair it with a *poisoned* weapon or a *poisoner* class feature that grants advantage on poison saves, making the save harder to succeed. |\n| **Tactics** | Because of the small range and area, Poison Spray is best for closing distance and hitting multiple enemies in a tight melee cluster (e.g., a 3‑creature melee line). It is also handy for finishing off a weakened target, as the damage dice are fairly large for a 1‑action spell. |\n| **Spell‑casting‑DC awareness** | A high‑level caster can increase the DC by taking a higher‑level slot for a *cantrip* (if you’re a *Warlock* using *The Eldritch Blast* as a cantrip, you can upgrade its level). For Wizards and Sorcerers you can use a higher‑level slot to **increase** the damage dice of the cantrip (if you have the *Higher‑Level Spell* rule for cantrips in your house rules). Some DMs allow this, but the PHB rules do not, so check with your DM. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Fast, short‑range burst** of poison that scales with your level.  \n- **Constitution save** only; no attack rolls.  \n- **No lingering** or concentration; simply a 5‑ft cone that deals 1–4d12 poison damage depending on level.  \n- Best used for **tight melee** situations or when you need a quick, high‑damage burst and you’re close enough to the enemy.  \n\nKeep the 5‑ft cone shape, the Constitution save, and the scaling in mind, and you’ll have a reliable tool for a veteran caster’s arsenal.", "reference": "Poison Spray is a Conjuration cantrip with a casting time of 1 action, a range of 10 feet, and components V and S.

Resilient Sphere 4th-level evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet Components: V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration. Nothing-not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects-can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it. The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures. A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends. Resurrection 7th-level necromancy Casting Time: 1 hour Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration: Instantaneous You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn’t die of old age, and that isn’t undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points. This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life. This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts. Comingback from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Reverse Gravity 7th-level transmutation Casting Time:1 action Range:100 feet Components:V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings) Duration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteThis spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall. If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration. At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down. Revivify 3rd-level necromancy Casting Time:1 action Range:Touch Components: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration: Instantaneous You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts. Rope Trick 2nd-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment) Duration: 1 hour You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends. The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space. Attacks and spells can’t cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. Sacred Flame Evocation cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

The creature **must have a body present**; if the body is missing or destroyed the spell fails. |\n| **Time since death** | The creature must have died **no longer than 10 years ago**.  If it has been dead for longer, the spell cannot work. (A 9th‑level spell, *True Resurrection*, can bypass this rule.) |\n| **Soul** | The creature’s soul must still be bound to its body (the creature must not be an undead or have its soul departed). |\n| **No special restrictions** | The creature must not be subject to an effect that explicitly forbids resurrection (e.g., certain death curses or “undead conversion” rules). |\n\nThe caster must expend a 7th‑level spell slot and a 500‑gp diamond, which is consumed by the spell.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What happens when the spell succeeds\n\n| Result | Effect |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Life** | The creature is restored to life with **1 hit point**. |\n| **Identity** | All memories, personality, and the creature’s previous abilities remain exactly as they were. The spell does **not** restore hit points beyond the single point, nor does it alter the creature’s class, level, or feats. |\n| **Equipment** | Any items the creature was wearing or carrying at the time of death remain on the corpse and can be recovered normally; they are **not** magically returned. |\n| **Conditions** | The creature is no longer dead, so death‑related conditions cease. Other conditions (poison, disease, status effects, etc.) that were affecting the creature at death are **not** automatically removed—they persist unless otherwise resolved. |\n| **Body** | If the body is intact and present, the soul re‑unites with it. No new body is created. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Limitations & penalties\n\n| Limitation | Effect |\n|------------|--------|\n| **10‑year death window** | Creatures dead longer than 10 years cannot be revived with *Resurrection*; *True Resurrection* (9th level) or a special item is required. |\n| **Body requirement** | No resurrection if the body is missing, destroyed, or otherwise unusable. |\n| **Class restrictions** | Only clerics and druids (or those with the spell on their class list) can cast it. |\n| **Cost** | Requires a 7th‑level slot and a 500‑gp diamond; the diamond is consumed. |\n| **No restoration of missing parts** | The spell does not regenerate missing limbs, organs, or equipment. |\n| **No cure of afflictions** | Diseases, curses, or other effects that were present at death remain unless otherwise treated. |\n| **No additional benefits** | The spell does not grant the caster any power over the resurrected creature (e.g., you cannot compel it to obey). |\n| **No effect on constructs or undead** | The spell targets living creatures; constructs, undead, and other non‑living forms cannot be resurrected. |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Practical notes\n\n* **Preparation** – The spell is on the cleric’s and druid’s spell lists; it can be prepared like any other spell.\n* **Timing** – Casting takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted time; the caster must maintain concentration on any ongoing spell? (No concentration is required for *Resurrection* itself, but the caster may still be affected by other ongoing effects.)\n* **Recovery** – The resurrected creature will need healing to regain more than 1 HP. It is otherwise indistinguishable from a freshly born or newly revived creature.\n* **DM discretion** – In some campaigns, DMs may allow *Resurrection* to work with a suitable new body or to ignore the 10‑year rule, but the PHB wording is clear on these requirements.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** *Resurrection* is a powerful, high‑level spell that can bring a creature back to life within the last decade, as long as its body is intact. The creature returns with only 1 HP, retains all memories and abilities, but does not get any additional benefits or healing beyond what the caster chooses to provide.

If a target knows you’re casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed. Knowledge Save Modifier Secondhand (y ou have heard of the target) +5 Firsthand (you have met the target) +0 Familiar (you know the target well) − 5 Connection Save Modifier Likeness or picture − 2 Possession or garment −4 Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like −10 On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist. Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t move. Secret Chest 4th-level conjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp) Duration: Instantaneous You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica. After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell’s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost. See I nvisibility 2nd-level divination Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver) Duration: 1 hour For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent. Seeming 5th-level illusion Casting Time:1 action Range:30 feet Components:V, S Duration:8 hoursThis spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell. The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised. Sending 3rd-level evocation Casting Time:1 action Range:Unlimited Components:V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire) Duration:1 roundYou send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar.

Their form becomes partially transparent, often glowing faintly, with edges that blur as if seen through mist or fog. |\n| **Ethereal Creature (e.g., *Ethereal Vortex*, *Ethereal Gloom* in home‑brew or older editions)** | Often described as semi‑solid beings that flicker in and out of existence. Their bodies may be outlined in silver or blue light, with tendrils or wisps of spectral energy trailing behind. They can appear as swirling mists, luminous silhouettes, or flickering shadows that shift position when looked at directly. |\n| **Ethereal Ghosts & Wraiths (classic monsters)** | These are usually shown as gaunt, skeletal frames that are mostly translucent, sometimes dripping with a cold, blue‑tinged aura. Their eyes, if visible, glow with a pale, otherworldly light, and their mouths may seem to whisper in unseen winds. |\n\nIf your spell descriptions contain unique wording—like “the creature’s skin flickers like a candle flame,” or “its eyes burn with a phosphorescent blue glow”—those details would refine the visual image further.

Sequester 7th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration: Until dispelled By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells. If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older. You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage. Shapechange 9th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form. You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak. When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state. During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value. Shatter 2nd-level evocation Casting Time:1action Range:60 feet Components:V, S, M (a chip of mica) Duration:InstantaneousA sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects. You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature’s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates. The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots. If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.

Speak with Plants 3rd-level transmutation Casting Time:1 action Range:Self (30-foot radius) Components:V, S Duration:10 minutesYou imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances. You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example. Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed. Spike Growth 2nd-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 150 feet Components: V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point) Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon can take whatever form you choose.

The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.

So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn’t possible.

Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect.

Teleport 7th-level conjuration Casting Time:1 action Range:10 feet Components:V Duration:InstantaneousThis spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. On Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to. Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area.You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. Mishap.The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time). Teleportation Circle 5th-level conjuration Casting Time:1 minute Range:10 feet Components:V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration:1 roundAs you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence-a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute. You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year.

The conditions that the glyph imposes—*frightened* or *confused*—do not stop telepathy, so the bond lets the party coordinate a response even when the glyph is going off.\n\n---\n\n### How it works in practice\n\n| Condition | Effect on normal communication | Effect on Telepathic Bond |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Frightened** | The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, can’t approach its source of fear, but can still speak, act, or think normally. | Telepathy is unaffected. The creature can still receive and send telepathic messages. |\n| **Confused** | The creature acts erratically: it may move or attack randomly. It can still speak, but its actions are unpredictable. | Telepathy is unaffected. The creature can still receive a telepathic message and, if it can concentrate on it, relay it. |\n\n**Key points of the spell**\n\n1. **Link** – Up to eight willing creatures within 120 ft. can communicate regardless of distance.  \n2. **Instantaneous thought exchange** – They can send a single “message” or share a thought per round.  \n3. **Unhindered by conditions** – Fear and confusion do not impose a restriction on telepathy, so the link remains active.  \n\n### What the party can do when the glyph triggers\n\n1. **Detect the trigger** – The creature that sees the glyph can immediately telepathically warn the others: *“Glyph triggered! It’s a fear glyph.”*  \n2. **Share the glyph’s nature** – They can all instantly know what type of glyph it is (fear, confusion, etc.) and how it will affect them.  \n3. **Coordinate a response** – The bonded group can agree on a plan in one round: *“Run to the west corridor, go through the second door.”*  \n4. **Mitigate confusion** – Even if one member is acting erratically, the others can still understand the message, and the confused creature can receive it and try to follow it, possibly breaking out of the confusion faster.  \n\n**Bottom line:** A Telepathic Bond does not grant immunity to fear or confusion, but it gives the party a reliable communication line that remains operational when a glyph’s effects start to bite.

Thus, the bonded group can still share information, coordinate their actions, and help each other escape or mitigate the glyph’s effects, all while the bond continues to function across the battlefield. The bond’s limitation to the same plane means it is unaffected by the glyph’s planar restrictions, ensuring reliable communication throughout the encounter.", "answer_relevancy": 0.765803468826677, "semantic_similarity": 0.45423815669306206, "bleu_score": 0.036733806172758926, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.1744186046511628, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.12032085561497326, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.31690140845070425}

The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days. Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events. Speak with Plants 3rd-level transmutation Casting Time:1 action Range:Self (30-foot radius) Components:V, S Duration:10 minutesYou imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances. You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example. Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks. If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it. This spell can cause the plants created by the entanglespellto release a restrained creature. Spider Climb 2nd-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed. Spike Growth 2nd-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 150 feet Components: V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point) Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it. Spirit Guardians 3rd-level conjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (15-foot radius) Components: V, S, M (a holy symbol) Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. At Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. Spiritual Weapon 2nd-level evocation Casting Time:1 bonus action Range: 60 feet Components:V, S Duration:1 minuteYou create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell’s effect resemble that weapon.

The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration. Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison.

The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused. The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone. If a creature is concentrating in the spell’s area, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration. Slow 3rd-level transmutation Casting Time:1 action Range:120 feet Components:V, S, M (a drop of molasses) Duration:Concentration, up to 1 minute You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration. An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted. A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it. Spare the Dying Necromancy cantrip Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. Speak with Animals 1st-level divination (ritual) Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V, S Duration: 10 minutes You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM’s discretion."], "response": "**Speak with Plants** (PHB, 1st‑level druid)  \n- **Range**: 30 ft.  \n- **Effect**: You can *communicate* with any plant within that radius. The plant can answer questions about the *area* and any *information it actually knows* (the spell doesn’t grant new knowledge).  \n- **Typical uses for terrain & creatures**  \n  * **Terrain** – A tree or vine can describe the layout of the forest: “The path to the north is a dry clearing; the roots there are exposed and the soil is shallow.”  It can note features the caster can’t see—such as a hidden spring, a fallen log that blocks a road, or a patch of unusual moss that marks a recent creature’s passage.  \n  * **Creatures** – If a plant has “felt” vibrations or scent through its roots (DM’s discretion), it can tell you that a creature passed nearby, what type of creature (e.g., “a large wolf,” “a pair of raptors”) and perhaps whether it was friendly or hostile.  Plants can’t see the creature, but they can sense disturbance in the ground, changes in light, or chemical cues.  \n  * **Magical / Environmental clues** – Some plants might sense auras or magical energies: “The air here hums with a low, constant pulse.”  This is handy for detecting wards or a hidden entrance.\n\n**Speak with Animals** (PHB, 1st‑level druid)  \n- **Range**: 30 ft.  \n- **Effect**: You can communicate with beasts in the area. The beast can answer questions about the *area* and anything it *has witnessed or sensed*.  \n- **Typical uses for terrain & creatures**  \n  * **Terrain** – A deer or wolf can give a “yes/no” answer about the safety of a path, or a brief description: “The trail to the east goes through a thicket, then opens into a glade.”  Animals rely on sight, hearing, and smell, so they can spot hazards the plants cannot (e.g., a hidden pit or a distant predator).  \n  * **Creatures** – Animals can identify and track other creatures they have seen, smell, or heard: “I saw a large black beast heading south.”  They can also warn you of immediate danger, such as an ambush or a pack of predators nearby.  \n  * **Limited environmental sense** – Most beasts lack the ability to sense subtle changes in the soil or magical auras, so they’re less useful for discovering hidden features that only a plant could detect.\n\n---\n\n### Key Differences for Information Gathering\n\n| Aspect | Speak with Plants | Speak with Animals |\n|--------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **What they can sense** | Roots, light, humidity, vibrations, plant‑specific cues | Sight, hearing, smell, and physical presence of other creatures |\n| **Terrain detail** | Can describe subtle or hidden features (e.g., roots, moisture, concealed springs) | Provides general navigation cues; less detailed on hidden features |\n| **Creature knowledge** | Can tell you that a creature *felt* its presence through the ground or sensed a disturbance | Can identify and track creatures they actually *saw* or *smelled |\n| **Utility in hidden or magical terrain** | Often better at detecting buried passages, magical auras, or plants altered by magic | Better at spotting predators, tracking scents, or detecting physical dangers |\n| **Limitations** | Plants don’t move, so they only have knowledge of their immediate surroundings | Animals may not know about hidden features beyond sight/odor |\n\n---\n\n### Practical Tips for a Player\n\n1. **Choose the right helper** – If you need a map of the terrain or a hint about a concealed feature, use Speak with Plants. If you’re concerned about nearby predators or want a quick direction, use Speak with Animals.  \n2. **Ask specific, sensory‑based questions** – “Do you sense any vibrations of movement within the next 100 ft?” (plants) vs. “Have you seen a wolf within the last hour?” (animals).  \n3. **Use the spell’s 30‑ft radius strategically** – Move the party or the plant/animal closer if you need information about a farther area, or cast the spell on a different plant/animal that’s already in that spot.  \n4. **Combine the information** – A plant may tell you a “dry clearing” and that it feels a “deep rumble” (possible subterranean feature), while an animal can confirm that the clearing is “safe” or “dangerous.”  \n\nIn short, **Speak with Plants** is your best bet for environmental lore and hidden features, whereas **Speak with Animals** is the go‑to spell for immediate creature detection and threat assessment. Using them in tandem gives the most complete picture of the surrounding area.", "reference": "Speak with Plants is a 3rd‑level transmutation spell that, when cast, imbues all plants within a 30‑foot radius of the caster with limited sentience and animation.  For the spell’s 10‑minute duration the caster can communicate with those plants and give them simple commands.  The caster may question the plants about events that occurred in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.  Additionally, the spell allows the caster to turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth into ordinary terrain for the duration, or to turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain, thereby affecting movement.  Plants might also perform tasks on the caster’s behalf at the GM’s discretion, and the spell can cause plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.

Symbol 7th-level abjuration Casting Time:1 minute Range:Touch Components:V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration:Until dispelled or triggeredWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able. Hopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects. Insanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish.

You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell. Creature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air. On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest. Object.You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell. You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn’t possible.

Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes. Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces additional effects on your turn. Round 2.Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage. Round 3.You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can’t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Round 4.Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Round 5-10.Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical. Suggestion 2nd-level enchantment Casting Time:1 action Range: 30 feet Components:V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil) Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hoursYou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed. If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends. Sunbeam 6th-level evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (60-foot line) Components: V, S, M (a magnifying glass) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line.

Spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.\nUntil the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.\n\nTongues\n3rd-level divination\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears. Moreover,\nwhen the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target understands what it says.\n\nTransport via Plants\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round This spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger inanimate plant within range and another plant, at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.\n\nTree Stride\n5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you’re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.  You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.\n\nTrue Polymorph\n9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.\nThis spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\nAn unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.\n\nCreature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number\nof hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n\nObject into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s size and\nthe creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.\n\nCreature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.\n\nTrue Resurrection\n9th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.  This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.  The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature’s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.\n\nTrue Seeing\n6th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nTrue Strike\nDivination cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 round You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target’s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn’t ended.\n\nUnseen Servant\n1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.\nOnce on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.\nIf you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.\n\nVampiric Touch\n3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteThe touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nVicious Mockery\nEnchantment cantrip\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V\nDuration: Instantaneous You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.  This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).\n\nWall of Fire\n4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.  When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.  One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.\n\nWall of Force\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).\nNothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by\ndispel magic.A disintegratespell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.\n\nWall of Ice\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nThe wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.\n\nWall of Stone\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small block of granite)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.  If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.  The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.  If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.  The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.  If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.\n\nWall of Thorns\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of thorns)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nA creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.\n\nWarding Bond\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.\nThe spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.\n\nWater Breathing\n3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)\nDuration:24 hoursThis spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.\n\nWater Walk\n3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of cork)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface-such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava-as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.  If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.\n\nWeb\n2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.  If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.  Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.  A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.  The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.\n\nWeird\n9th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to one minute Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.\n\nWind Walk\n6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (fire and holy water)\nDuration:8 hoursYou and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.\nIf a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.\n\nWind Wall\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteA wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.\n\nWish\n9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.  The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.  Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n•You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no morethan 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n•You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n•You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n•You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.\n•You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a\nwishspell could undo an opponent’s successful save, afoe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to usethe reroll or the original roll.You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast\nwishever again if you suffer this stress.\n\nWord of Recall\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:5 feet\nComponents:V\nDuration:InstantaneousYou and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.\nYou must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn’t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.\n\nZone of Truth\n2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:10 minutes\nYou create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.  An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.\n"], "response": "**Warding Bond** (5e, 2nd‑level abjuration)\n\n| Element | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Casting time** | 1 action |\n| **Range** | Touch (you must touch the target to establish the bond) |\n| **Components** | V, S, M (a silver chain worth at least 50 gp, which is consumed) |\n| **Duration** | 1 hour (concentration not required) |\n\n**Effect**\n\n1. **Bond** – You and the chosen creature become magically linked for the spell’s duration.\n2. **Defensive bonuses** – The target gains **+1 to AC** and **+1 to hit points** (its maximum HP increases by 1 for the spell’s duration).\n3. **Damage sharing** – Whenever the target takes damage, you take **half** that damage (rounded down).  \n   *You do **not** heal from that damage; it simply reduces the damage you suffer.*\n4. **Disruption** – The bond ends immediately if either you or the target:\n   * dies,\n   * is taken out of range (e.g., moved more than 30 ft away after the spell is cast),\n   * or the spell is dispelled.\n\n**Notes**\n\n- The spell is not a healing spell; the bonus HP is temporary.\n- The target must be within 30 ft. when the spell ends (the 1‑hour duration can be interrupted by moving farther).\n- The spell can be cast on yourself; you would then share the damage with yourself.\n\n**Quick recap**: *Warding Bond* ties you to a target, giving them a small AC and HP boost, and protects you by absorbing half of any damage they take for up to an hour.", "reference": "Warding Bond is a 2nd‑level abjuration spell.

The spell ends if you leave its area.\nNine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.\nUntil the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.\n\nTongues\n3rd-level divination\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears. Moreover,\nwhen the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target understands what it says.\n\nTransport via Plants\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round This spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger inanimate plant within range and another plant, at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.\n\nTree Stride\n5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you’re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.  You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.\n\nTrue Polymorph\n9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.\nThis spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\nAn unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.\n\nCreature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number\nof hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n\nObject into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s size and\nthe creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.\n\nCreature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.\n\nTrue Resurrection\n9th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.  This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.  The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature’s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.\n\nTrue Seeing\n6th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nTrue Strike\nDivination cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 round You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target’s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn’t ended.\n\nUnseen Servant\n1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.\nOnce on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.\nIf you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.\n\nVampiric Touch\n3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteThe touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nVicious Mockery\nEnchantment cantrip\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V\nDuration: Instantaneous You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.  This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).\n\nWall of Fire\n4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.  When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.  One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.\n\nWall of Force\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).\nNothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by\ndispel magic.A disintegratespell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.\n\nWall of Ice\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nThe wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.\n\nWall of Stone\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small block of granite)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.  If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.  The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.  If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.  The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.  If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.\n\nWall of Thorns\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of thorns)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nA creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.\n\nWarding Bond\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)\nDuration:1 hourThis spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.\nThe spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.\n\nWater Breathing\n3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)\nDuration:24 hoursThis spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.\n\nWater Walk\n3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of cork)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface-such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava-as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.  If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.\n\nWeb\n2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.  If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.  Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.  A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.  The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.\n\nWeird\n9th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to one minute Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.\n\nWind Walk\n6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (fire and holy water)\nDuration:8 hoursYou and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.\nIf a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.\n\nWind Wall\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteA wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.\n\nWish\n9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.  The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.  Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n•You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no morethan 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n•You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n•You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n•You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.\n•You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a\nwishspell could undo an opponent’s successful save, afoe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to usethe reroll or the original roll.You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast\nwishever again if you suffer this stress.\n\nWord of Recall\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:5 feet\nComponents:V\nDuration:InstantaneousYou and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.\nYou must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn’t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.\n\nZone of Truth\n2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:10 minutes\nYou create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.  An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.\n"], "response": "**Vampiric Touch** – 3rd‑level necromancy (PHB)\n\n| Feature | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Casting time** | 1 action |\n| **Range** | Touch (you must be within 5 ft of the target) |\n| **Components** | V, S, M (a drop of blood, a bone, or a piece of a corpse) |\n| **Duration** | 1 minute (the spell itself ends after this time; you can keep it “active” by using a bonus action each turn for the full minute) |\n| **Effect** | • On a successful melee spell attack, the target takes **3d6 necrotic damage**. <br>• You regain hit points equal to **half the damage dealt** (rounded down). <br>• While the spell is active, you may use a bonus action on each of your turns to make the same melee spell attack against any creature within 5 ft of you (same damage/heal). |\n| **Higher‑level slots** | The damage increases by **1d6** for each slot level above 3rd.

Below are practical rules‑checks, narrative pitfalls, and a handful of fresh ways to make the spell feel epic in your story.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Quick Rules Recap\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| **Casting Time** | 1 action |\n| **Duration** | 1d4 + 1 rounds (up to 5 rounds) |\n| **Effect** | Time stops for everyone but the caster. Creatures can’t act, but they **do** keep their initiative order. |\n| **Limits** | You can’t move through a creature’s space, affect them directly, or cast spells that target them. If you cast a spell that would target a creature, *Time Stop* ends immediately. |\n| **Ending** | You end it voluntarily or when the round counter runs out. |\n\n*(If you’re worried about breaking the rules, remember that a character could always “sneak” out a spell that *doesn’t* target a creature, like a *Shield* or *Mage Hand*, but those won’t have lasting effect on enemies.)*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Narrative Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n| Pitfall | How to Fix It |\n|---------|---------------|\n| **Over‑taming the moment** – “time stops forever” | Keep the duration tight (1–5 rounds). Make the hero feel the urgency of using every second. |\n| **Instant wins** – “I just defeated the dragon” | Use it to *reposition* or *setup* rather than outright kill. Let the real fight begin when time resumes. |\n| **No consequences** – “everyone else is just frozen” | Even while frozen, a villain could still use a pre‑cast spell, drop a trap, or change the terrain. Make the pause a tactical advantage, not a cheat. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Cool, Creative Uses\n\n### 3.1. **“The Grand Pause” – A Spectacle of Power**\n\n- **Scene**: The party is locked in a desperate battle against an ancient lich. The party’s wizard casts *Time Stop* to free everyone’s initiative order, creating a dramatic “time‑slicing” visual.\n- **Effect**: He uses the pause to **teleport** the lich out of the arena, or to **create a barrier of ice** that freezes the lich’s weapons, rendering them inert.\n- **Narrative Twist**: While everyone is frozen, the lich *has* a few seconds to cast a single spell that will trigger after time resumes (e.g., a *Finger of Death* that goes off when the lich is freed). The tension of a single moment of “danger” after the pause makes the moment epic.\n\n### 3.2. **“The Silent Coup” – Turning the Tide**\n\n- **Scenario**: A party member is about to be killed by a swarm of hostile spirits. The healer casts *Time Stop* and uses it to *raise a hidden, protective ward* (e.g., a circle of *Globe of Invulnerability*) before the spirits arrive.\n- **Result**: When time resumes, the spirits burst into the ward and are automatically repelled or destroyed. The moment is a dramatic reversal of fate.\n\n### 3.3. **“A Moment of Insight” – Gaining a Tactical Edge**\n\n- **Idea**: While enemies are frozen, the caster reads the *future* by casting a *Predict* or *Arcane Eye* that “spies” on the next few turns. This gives the party a *precise* map of how to dodge incoming attacks, making the subsequent combat feel like a well‑played chess match.\n\n### 3.4. **“The Time‑Bender’s Trap” – A Creative Twist**\n\n- **Plot**: A villain uses *Time Stop* to set a *temporal trap*: while the heroes are frozen, he drops a magical cage that binds anyone who tries to leave the battlefield after time resumes. The heroes now have to *undo* the trap while the enemy waits for them to finish.\n- **Why it’s epic**: It flips the usual narrative—time stops *for the heroes*, but the villain uses it to *trap them*.\n\n### 3.5. **“The Last Breath” – A Self‑Sacrificial Moment**\n\n- **Story**: The final battle against a godlike adversary leaves the heroes on the brink of death. A dying paladin casts *Time Stop* to “freeze” the god’s *last spell* in place, giving the party a sliver of time to strike the final blow—an act of ultimate heroism.\n\n### 3.6. **“An Alternate Reality” – Temporal Shifting**\n\n- **Creative Use**: Use *Time Stop* to “swap” places with a nearby portal or to *shift* the battlefield’s coordinates (e.g., bring a battlefield from a distant plane into the current one). The shift itself becomes an epic spectacle, reshaping the entire combat arena.\n\n### 3.7. **“The Hidden Witness” – Observing the Unseen**\n\n- **Narrative**: While enemies are frozen, the caster can use *Time Stop* to spy on a distant location—e.g., the hidden lair of an ancient tyrant—without revealing themselves. The discovery adds stakes and foreshadows future plot twists.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to Write It\n\n1. **Set the Stage**  \n   *“The air crackled, the sky split, and the world fell silent as the wizard’s words hung in the air.”*  \n   Use vivid sensory detail.\n\n2. **Show the Pause**  \n   *“For a heartbeat, the sword hung halfway to the enemy’s throat, the dragon’s wing motionless, the entire battlefield suspended like a frozen tableau.”*\n\n3. **Highlight the Tactical Move**  \n   *“He lifted the cloak of invisibility, drew his sigil, and—within a blink—wove a protective dome that shivered with the power of the elements.”*\n\n4. **End with Resumption**  \n   *“And then, like a drumroll, time resumed: the dome erupted, the dragon’s wings unfurled, and the battle roared to life.”*\n\n5. **Add a Hook**  \n   *“But not all was as it seemed; the very pause had left a fissure in reality—an unseen echo that would soon bring a new threat.”*\n\n---\n\n## 5. Bottom Line\n\n*Time Stop* is about more than a pause; it’s a dramatic tool to re‑frame combat, to craft a moment of high tension, or to shift the entire narrative direction. Use it to:\n\n- **Reposition** your heroes or enemies dramatically.\n- **Create** protective barriers or traps.\n- **Reveal** future consequences before they happen.\n- **Add** a layer of psychological tension (the enemy might act when time resumes).\n\nWith careful adherence to the rules and a dash of narrative flair, *Time Stop* can transform a routine battle into a memorable, epic crescendo in your story.

The barrier lasts for the duration. The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier. If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends. Antimagic Field 8th-level abjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere) Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. Magical Travel.Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trickspell, temporarily closes while in the sphere. Creatures and Objects.A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere. Dispel Magic.Spells and magical effects such as dispel magichave no effect on the sphere.

What the rules say\n\n| Rule | Source | What it tells us |\n|------|--------|------------------|\n| **Antimagic Field** | PHB p.285 | “A 10‑ft radius sphere. **Any magic effect that would occur in its area is suppressed.**” |\n| **Area spells** | PHB p.285‑286 | “If an effect would affect a creature in an area, it can be suppressed if that creature is inside an antimagic field.” |\n| **Fireball** | PHB p.258 | Instantaneous, 20‑ft radius; each creature in the area takes damage or makes a Dex save. |\n\n**Interpretation**  \nThe AMF does **not** cancel the entire spell unless the whole area of effect lies inside the field. Instead, it suppresses the magical effect *within* its 10‑ft radius. For area spells the suppression applies to the portion of the area that lies inside the field, while the rest of the area remains unaffected.\n\nThis is how most Sage Advice and official errata have interpreted the interaction: the field “splits” the area spell into a suppressed zone and a normal zone.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  How the interaction plays out in practice\n\n| Situation | What happens |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| **AMF entirely inside the Fireball** | The fireball’s blast is fully suppressed. No fire, no damage, no visual effect anywhere. |\n| **AMF partially overlapping** | The fireball detonates normally **outside** the AMF. Inside the AMF nothing happens: no heat, no flame, no damage. The field creates a clear, “cool” bubble inside the otherwise blazing sphere. |\n| **AMF created after the Fireball** | The fireball’s damage is already dealt. The AMF suppresses any *new* magical effects that would occur inside it (e.g., a lingering flame effect if the DM rules Fireball leaves a burning area). It does not roll back damage that has already been applied. |\n| **Creatures inside AMF** | Those creatures take no damage and do not need to make the Dex saving throw. Creatures outside still take full damage or benefit from a successful save. |\n| **Fireball is a target spell (e.g., *Banishment* onto a point)** | The same principle: the spell’s effect is suppressed inside the field; the target inside AMF is unaffected. |\n\n### Visual / Battlefield manifestation\n- **Fireball outside AMF**: Bright flash, roaring wind, flames erupt, heat radiates.  \n- **AMF zone**: A 10‑ft radius sphere that is “magically dead.” The fireball’s bright streak simply stops at the boundary; inside the sphere you see a cold, silent area, no flames, no heat, no smoke.  \n\nDMs sometimes describe the AMF as a shimmering, translucent bubble that “cuts” the fireball’s blast. The rest of the battlefield is unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Edge‑case notes & uncertainties\n\n1. **Suppression vs. negation** – The AMF suppresses the spell’s *effect*; the spell still “exists” but is inert inside the field.  \n2. **Partial overlap** – The official text does not spell out “partial” suppression, but the consensus (Sage Advice, DMG notes) is that area spells are split.  \n3. **Timing** – If the AMF is created *after* the fireball has already detonated, the suppression does not retroactively remove damage.  \n4. **Continuous effects** – If a fireball leaves a lingering flame (DM’s call), the AMF would suppress that continuous effect inside its area.  \n\nIf you run into a DM’s call that differs, it’s usually a house‑rule or a different interpretation. The safest default is: *suppress the portion of the spell’s effect that lies inside the antimagic field.*\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Inside the AMF**: No fireball effect, no damage, no saves.  \n- **Outside the AMF**: Normal fireball damage and effect.  \n\nThe battlefield ends up with a “gap” in the fireball’s radius, where the AMF sits like a bubble of silence amid the blaze.", "reference": "When a fireball is cast and its area overlaps an antimagic field, the portion of the fireball's area that falls inside the sphere is suppressed.

You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect. Antipathy.The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

The eye’s sight is **normal vision** (i.e., whatever vision you personally possess: normal, darkvision, truesight, etc.).  If you have darkvision, the eye inherits that range; if you have truesight, the eye does too.  The eye can look in **all directions** (360°).  It cannot see through walls or other solid objects; it sees only the environment it “looks at” like any other creature.  Invisible or hidden creatures aren’t automatically revealed; the eye sees only what you could normally see.\n\n* **Movement** – The eye can move at a speed of **30 ft per round**.  You can direct it each round to move anywhere it can “fly” (i.e., through gaps and small openings but not through solid walls).  The eye can travel anywhere within its 1‑hour lifetime, limited only by that speed.\n\n* **Control & Interaction** – You may look through the eye at any time without spending actions; it’s simply a continuous effect.  The eye can be moved or repositioned by a free action (the DM may rule that you use your movement or a bonus action to move the eye; the rulebook leaves this a matter of DM discretion).  The eye is invisible, so you can’t normally see it unless you have a spell or effect that reveals invisible objects.\n\n---\n\n### Limitations & Restrictions\n\n| Limitation | What it means |\n|------------|----------------|\n| **No concentration** | You can keep other spells up while the eye remains; you can cast other spells without ending it. |\n| **No special sensory powers** | The eye only has whatever sight you have.  It can’t read thoughts, detect hidden objects, or see through concealment unless you have the requisite senses (e.g., truesight). |\n| **Cannot see invisible creatures** | Unless you can see them normally, the eye won’t reveal invisible beings.  Likewise, invisible traps, wards, or magic that hides from divination still remain hidden. |\n| **Cannot pass through solid objects** | The eye is incorporeal but still respects solid matter.  It can move through gaps and small openings but can’t “phase” through walls. |\n| **Cannot detect magic or read lore** | The spell gives no special ability to sense spell effects or read books.  You’d need other divination spells (e.g., *detect magic*, *comprehend languages*) to gather that information. |\n| **End conditions** | The spell ends after 1 hour, if you cast *Arcane Eye* again (the new eye replaces the old one), or if you **dispel** it (e.g., *dispel magic* or *dispel evil*).  The eye can also be destroyed by damage from a spell that deals damage to objects, but this is rarely a concern. |\n\n---\n\n### Practical Uses\n\n1. **Reconnaissance** – Scan an area, a room, or a corridor that’s otherwise inaccessible or too dangerous to enter.\n2. **Surveillance** – Keep an eye on a doorway, a trap, or a guarded gate while you remain hidden.\n3. **Spotting Hidden Doors/Passages** – Since the eye can see in all directions, it can spot hidden hinges or doorways that a single creature might miss.\n4. **Watching Over a Battlefield** – View enemy positions from a safe distance; useful for spellcasters who need to keep a safe distance.\n5. **Remote Observation** – Look over a chasm or up a tower without physically climbing it.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nArcane Eye lets you “look out of a magic eye” that flies around at 30 ft per round.  It gives you ordinary vision (including any special vision you possess) and can see in all directions, but it can’t pierce walls, see invisible things, or read hidden lore.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it. Clenched Fist.The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage. Forceful Hand.The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it. Grasping Hand.The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Interposing Hand.The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target. At Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.

You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes. While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.

The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age. Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly. Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it. The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens. The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation. If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.

The GM chooses from the following possible omens: •Weal, for good results •Woe, for bad results •Weal and woe, for both good and bad results •Nothing, for results that aren’t especially good orbadThe spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret. Awaken 5th-level transmutation Casting Time: 8 hours Range:Touch Components:V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration:InstantaneousAfter spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human’s. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree. The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed. Bane 1st-level enchantment Casting Time:1 action Range:30 feet Components:V, S, M (a drop of blood) Duration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteUp to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws.

Sound does not travel; thoughts and memories can, however. |\n| **Time** | Time does not flow here; what counts is *experience* and *intention*. |\n| **Travel** | Most often accessed via *astral projection* (e.g., *planar travel* or the *Astral Sea*). It is the only place where you can *safely* travel from one plane to another. |\n| **Living Things** | No true “living” creatures as we know them. Most beings here are manifestations of thoughts, astral projections, or wandering souls. The plane hosts various non‑human entities such as the *Celestials* (e.g., stars), the *Wraiths*, and the *Astral Void* (a region of raw psychic energy). |\n| **Interaction Rules** | • **No sleep** – A character who enters the Astral Plane cannot sleep or take a long rest. <br>• **No combat** – If a creature enters the Astral, it can’t attack or be attacked; the space is essentially a “no‑fight” zone. <br>• **No damage** – Physical injury doesn’t apply; instead, astral wounds are mental or emotional. <br>• **Teleportation** – While traveling, you can jump from one point to another, provided you are aware of your destination’s location. |\n| **Notable Entities** | • **Eldritch Horror** – the terrifying, incomprehensible presence at the center of the plane. <br>• **Astral Void** – a region of raw psychic energy that can sap the mind. <br>• **Celestial Guardians** – stars and other cosmic entities that occasionally guard passage. |\n\n---\n\n### Practical Tips for Players\n\n1. **Entering the Astral**  \n   - Use *planar travel* or *astral projection* feats.  \n   - Be prepared: you can’t take a long rest while inside.  \n\n2. **While Inside**  \n   - You’re effectively “floating” in a void; use your senses for navigation (you usually know the direction you came from).  \n   - If you need to “walk,” you’re simply moving your consciousness; you’ll still need a target location or the knowledge of how to reach it.\n\n3. **Exiting**  \n   - You can leave via any planar portal that appears, or by simply projecting back to the material plane if you maintain the necessary focus.\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\nThe Astral Plane is a limitless, thought‑based space above the Material Plane that acts as a conduit for interplanar travel. It has no gravity, no sleep, and no conventional combat, but it’s the only safe way to move from one world to another in the D&D cosmology.", "reference": "The Astral Plane is a plane you can project into with the spell.

The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.\nSlimy Doom. The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.\n\nContingency\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 10 days Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with water breathingmight stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.  The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.  The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.\n\nContinual Flame\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A\ncontinual flamecan be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.\n\nControl Water\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:300 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with\nit to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if\nthe water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the\nbase, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.  When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.  The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\n\nControl Weather\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self (5-mile radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.  When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.  When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.\n\nPrecipitation\nStage  Condition                                    \n1      Clear                                        \n2      Light clouds                                 \n3      Overcast or ground fog                       \n4      Rain, hail, or snow                          \n5      Torrential rain, driving  hail, or blizzard  \n\n\nTemperature\nStage  Condition        \n1      Unbearable heat  \n2      Hot              \n3      Warm             \n4      Cool             \n5      Cold             \n6      Arctic cold      \n\n\nWind\nStage  Condition      \n1      Calm           \n2      Moderate wind  \n3      Strong wind    \n4      Gale           \n5      Storm          \n\n\nCounterspell\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.\nAt\nHigher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.\n\nCreate Food and Water\n3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn’t go bad.\n\nCreate or Destroy Water\n1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of water if creating water or a few grains of sand if destroying it)\nDuration: Instantaneous You either create or destroy water.\nCreate Water. You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.\nDestroy Water. You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot cube within range.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.\n\nCreate Undead\n6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black onyx stone for each corpse)\nDuration: Instantaneous You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)  As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.  The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.\n\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell\nusing an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.\n\nCreation\n5th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create)\nDuration:SpecialYou pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of\na form and material that you have seen before.\nThe duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.\nMaterial               Duration    \nVegetable matter       1 day       \nStone or crystal       12 hours    \nPrecious  metals       1 hour      \nGems                   10 minutes  \nAdamantine or mithral  1 minute    \n\nUsing any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.\n\nCure Wounds\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Instantaneous\nA creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.\n\nDancing Lights\nEvocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.  As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.\n\nDarkness\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.  If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.  If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.\n\nDarkvision\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)\nDuration:8 hoursYou touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.\n\nDaylight\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:1 hourA 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.\nIf you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.\nIf any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.\n\nDeath Ward\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:8 hoursYou touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.\nThe first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.\nIf the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.\n\nDelayed Blast Fireball\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.  If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.  The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.\n\nDemiplane\n8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: 1 hour You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.  Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.\n\nDetect Evil and Good\n1st-level divination\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesFor the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\n\nDetect Magic\n1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutesFor the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\n\nDetect Poison and Disease\n1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S, M (a yew leaf)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesFor the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\n\nDetect Thoughts\n2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a copper piece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.  You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature-what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.  Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.  You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.  Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.\n"], "response": "**Mindfire (D&D 3.5 e)**  \n*Source: Monster Manual II (p. 122)*  \n\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Type** | Disease |\n| **Incubation** | 1 day |\n| **Duration** | 2 weeks (unless cured) |\n| **Spread** | Contact with a creature suffering from mindfire or its secretions |\n| **Symptoms** | The victim feels a burning, searing pain in the head. |\n| **Effects** | • The target takes **2d6 mental damage** at the start of each round.<br>• The target receives a **–4 penalty on all Will saves**.<br>• The damage is halved for those with a very high mental score (e.g., ≥18). |\n| **Cure** | A **DC 20 Wisdom check** (or a **DC 15 basic saving throw**—the exact method varies by campaign).

If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.\n\nContagion\n5th-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponent:V, S\nDuration:7 daysYour touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.\nAt the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves.

You cast that spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with water breathingmight stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.  The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.  The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.\n\nContinual Flame\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A\ncontinual flamecan be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.\n\nControl Water\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:300 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with\nit to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if\nthe water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the\nbase, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.  When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.  The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\n\nControl Weather\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self (5-mile radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.  When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.  When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.\n\nPrecipitation\nStage  Condition                                    \n1      Clear                                        \n2      Light clouds                                 \n3      Overcast or ground fog                       \n4      Rain, hail, or snow                          \n5      Torrential rain, driving  hail, or blizzard  \n\n\nTemperature\nStage  Condition        \n1      Unbearable heat  \n2      Hot              \n3      Warm             \n4      Cool             \n5      Cold             \n6      Arctic cold      \n\n\nWind\nStage  Condition      \n1      Calm           \n2      Moderate wind  \n3      Strong wind    \n4      Gale           \n5      Storm          \n\n\nCounterspell\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.\nAt\nHigher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.\n\nCreate Food and Water\n3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn’t go bad.\n\nCreate or Destroy Water\n1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of water if creating water or a few grains of sand if destroying it)\nDuration: Instantaneous You either create or destroy water.\nCreate Water. You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.\nDestroy Water. You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot cube within range.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.\n\nCreate Undead\n6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black onyx stone for each corpse)\nDuration: Instantaneous You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)  As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.  The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.\n\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell\nusing an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.\n\nCreation\n5th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create)\nDuration:SpecialYou pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of\na form and material that you have seen before.\nThe duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.\nMaterial               Duration    \nVegetable matter       1 day       \nStone or crystal       12 hours    \nPrecious  metals       1 hour      \nGems                   10 minutes  \nAdamantine or mithral  1 minute    \n\nUsing any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.\n\nCure Wounds\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Instantaneous\nA creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.\n\nDancing Lights\nEvocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.  As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.\n\nDarkness\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.  If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.  If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.\n\nDarkvision\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)\nDuration:8 hoursYou touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.\n\nDaylight\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:1 hourA 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.\nIf you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.\nIf any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.\n\nDeath Ward\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:8 hoursYou touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.\nThe first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.\nIf the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.\n\nDelayed Blast Fireball\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.  If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.  The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.\n\nDemiplane\n8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: 1 hour You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.  Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.\n\nDetect Evil and Good\n1st-level divination\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesFor the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\n\nDetect Magic\n1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutesFor the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\n\nDetect Poison and Disease\n1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S, M (a yew leaf)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesFor the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\n\nDetect Thoughts\n2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a copper piece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.  You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature-what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.  Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.  You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.  Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.\n"], "response": "**Contact Other Plane – 5e (PHB)**  \n\nThe spell is a 5‑level divination that lets you “call up” an otherworldly being and ask it one question.  \nThe target (the entity you’re contacting) must make a *Wisdom* saving throw.\n\n| Target’s Save | Result |\n|---------------|--------|\n| **Failed** | The creature *must* answer your question truthfully.

The destination must be an unoccupied space; if the space you choose is occupied, you land in the nearest unoccupied space.\n- **No “through‑walls”** – The spell does not allow you to move through solid objects; you must teleport to a location you can actually reach, though you can choose a point that you cannot see if you’re teleporting only yourself.\n- **Willing creature requirement** – The companion must be willing and within 5 feet of you when you cast the spell. If you can’t see the creature, you can’t bring it along.\n- **Objects** – You can bring one object with you, but it must be within your carrying capacity and not more than the spell’s limit (typically, a single item you can hold).\n- **No damage or saving throw** – The spell is purely instantaneous and requires no concentration or checks.\n\n### Practical Notes\n\n- **Teleport alone** – If you omit a target, you can teleport by yourself to any unoccupied point within 500 feet.\n- **Teleporting through a doorway** – The spell doesn’t “push” you through a door; you simply appear on the other side if that spot is free.\n- **Falling or falling damage** – Because the spell ends before you hit the ground, you are immune to falling damage from the teleport itself, but any terrain you land on still applies normally.\n- **Multiple uses** – The spell can be cast as many times as you have 2nd‑level spell slots and can be cast with higher-level slots for the same effect (no extra range or benefit).\n\nIn short, **Dimension Door** is a quick, 2nd‑level teleport that lets you (and a willing ally) instantly jump up to 500 feet to a chosen, unoccupied spot.

A caster can first *Dominate Beast* on a beast, then *Dominate Person* on a humanoid (or any other creature that qualifies).  \n2. The two spells work the same way—each creates a telepathic link, issues a command, and requires a Wisdom saving throw—but they differ in:\n   * spell level (4th vs 5th)  \n   * concentration requirement  \n   * duration (1 min vs 1 hr)  \n   * higher‑level slot effects (none)  \n3. “Swing/throw” mechanics are governed by the target’s normal actions: a beast can only do what a beast can normally do (bite, claw, bite‑swings, etc.), while a humanoid can do anything it can normally do (weapon attacks, spells, special maneuvers, etc.).  \n\nBelow is a concise comparison and a quick “how‑to” guide for chaining the spells.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How to chain *Dominate Beast* → *Dominate Person*\n\n| Step | Action | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 1 | **Target a beast** | Use a 4th‑level slot (or higher, but no extra benefit). The beast must be able to understand a language and make a Wisdom save. |\n| 2 | **Maintain concentration** | *Dominate Beast* lasts 1 minute while you concentrate. |\n| 3 | **Command the beast** | You can give any verbal command (subject to the beast’s normal capabilities). |\n| 4 | **Target a humanoid** | While you are still concentrating on the beast, you can cast *Dominate Person* on a humanoid (5th‑level spell). The humanoid must also make a Wisdom save. |\n| 5 | **Control two creatures** | *Dominate Person* does **not** require concentration, so you can keep both spells active. |\n| 6 | **Ending the first spell** | If you lose concentration (e.g., you take damage, cast a spell that forces a new concentration), *Dominate Beast* ends, but *Dominate Person* remains. |\n| 7 | **Ending the second spell** | *Dominate Person* ends after 1 hour or if you cast a spell that forces a new concentration (though it doesn't require concentration, it can still end if you use a spell that forces a new concentration on a different creature—e.g., *Hold Person*). |\n\n> **Rule‑check:**  \n> • *Dominate Beast* can’t be cast on a humanoid.  \n> • *Dominate Person* can’t be cast on a beast.  \n> • A creature can’t be under both spells at the same time (you can only target it with one “dominate” spell).  \n\n---\n\n## 2.

No. <br>• You can issue verbal commands in a language the beast understands. <br>• The beast cannot use its own actions that require concentration. | • Same: verbal commands in a language the humanoid understands. <br>• The humanoid can use any action it normally can (including spell‑casting, special attacks, etc.). |\n| **Higher‑level slots** | No extra effect (the spell’s power is unchanged). | No extra effect. |\n| **Limit on command** | You can only give commands that the beast can physically perform (e.g., bite, claw, charge). | You can command the humanoid to use any weapon or spell, as long as it’s within its normal capabilities. |\n| **Combat usage** | Often used to have a beast perform a powerful melee attack (bite, claws, etc.) or to act as a “tether” (grab an opponent). | Often used to have a humanoid act as a soldier, throw a projectile, or cast a spell. |\n| **\"Swing/throw\" mechanics** | The beast’s natural attack can be “swung” (claws, bite) or it can throw a weapon if it knows how (rare). The DM decides if it can perform a thrown attack. | The humanoid can throw a weapon or use any action that involves a swing or throw, as per its normal rules. |\n\n> **Key takeaway:** *Dominate Person* offers a longer, concentration‑free control, but it requires a humanoid target. *Dominate Beast* is shorter, concentration‑bound, but gives you control over a beast’s natural, often devastating, attacks.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Higher‑level casting\n\n- **Both spells do NOT gain additional effects when cast using a higher‑level slot.**  \n  *DMG p. 258* notes: “If you cast *Dominate Beast* or *Dominate Person* using a spell slot higher than its normal level, the spell’s power does not increase.”  \n  Thus, casting *Dominate Beast* with a 5th‑level slot or *Dominate Person* with a 6th‑level slot still gives the same 1 minute (with concentration) or 1 hour (no concentration) durations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical tips for a caster\n\n1. **Plan the battlefield**: Position your controlled beast in front of enemies and use *Dominate Person* to order a humanoid to cast a damaging spell on a key target.\n2. **Keep concentration safe**: Protect your *Dominate Beast* by staying out of combat or using the *Mage Armor* spell on the beast to keep it alive longer.\n3. **Use a ranged spell to cast *Dominate Person***: Since *Dominate Person* requires no concentration, you can cast a ranged spell (e.g., *Fireball*) to keep the beast in place while you finish the second domination.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nA caster can control a beast and a humanoid simultaneously by casting *Dominate Beast* (4th level, 1‑minute, concentration) on a beast and *Dominate Person* (5th level, 1‑hour, no concentration) on a humanoid. The telepathic link works in the same way for both spells, but *Dominate Person* lets you issue more varied commands and lasts longer. Higher‑level slots do not alter either spell’s effect.", "reference": "Both Dominate Beast and Dominate Person are enchantment spells that beguile a creature with a Wisdom sving throw. Dominate Beast is a 4th‑level spell while Dominate Person is a 5th‑level spell. The casting time, range, and components are identical: 1 action, 60 feet, verbal and somatic. The duration is concentration, up to 1 minute, and the spell can be extended by using higher level slots. For Dominate Beast the duration becomes 10 minutes with a 5th‑level slot, 1 hour with a 6th‑level slot, and 8 hours with a 7th‑level or higher slot. Dominate Person follows the same pattern but the base spell is one level higher, so the spell can be cast with a 6th‑level slot for 10 minutes, a 7th‑level slot for 1 hour, and a 8th‑level or higher slot for 8 hours. The mechanics of the telepathic link, the ability to issue simple commands, and the option to take total and precise control are identical for both spells. The only difference is the creature type that can be targeted: Dominate Beast can target beasts, while Dominate Person can target humanoids. Both spells require a Wisdom sving throw; if the target succeeds it is not charmed, and if it fails it is charmed for the duration. Each time the charmed creature takes damage it must make a new Wisdom sving throw, and a successful throw ends the spell. The spells also grant the caster a telepathic link with the target as long as both are on the same plane of existence. Because Dominate Person is a higher level spell, it can be cast with a higher level slot to achieve the same extended durations as Dominate Beast, but it is limited to humanoids.

Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move. If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams. You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.  When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again  While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.\nYour steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.\nWhen the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.\nWhile your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.\nYou can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.  This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.\n\nFinger of Death\n7th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain.

It ignites flammable objects in the area\nthat aren’t being worn or carried.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nFire Bolt\nEvocation cantrip\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousYou hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range.

The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.\nIn addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts\nwith flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.\n\nFire Storm\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube.

If the target’s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected.\nA creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each\nof its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.  If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.  If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.\n\nFloating Disk\n1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.  The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.  If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.\n\nFly\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You touch a willing creature.

For the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the\ngatespell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the\nplane shiftspell.\nIn addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.\nThe spell’s area can’t overlap with the area ofanother\nforbiddancespell. If you cast forbiddance\nevery day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.\n\nForcecage\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 100 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 1 hour An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.  When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.  A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. This spell can’t be dispelled by dispel magic.\n\nForesight\n9th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)\nDuration: 8 hours You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future.

Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target’s movement or attacks.\n\nFreezing Sphere\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:300 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)\nDuration:InstantaneousA frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.\nIf the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.\n"], "response": "**False Life** (Player’s Handbook, 5e)\n\n- **Level & School:** 1st‑level necromancy  \n- **Casting Time:** 1 action  \n- **Range:** Self  \n- **Components:** V, S  \n- **Duration:** 1 hour  \n- **Concentration:** No\n\nWhen you cast it, you temporarily “cheat” the game by adding a cushion of life to yourself:\n\n- **Effect:** You gain **1d6 + 3 temporary hit points**.  \n- These hit points are added to your current HP and are lost before any other damage or healing is applied.  \n- The temporary HP lasts for up to an hour (or until they’re depleted), giving you a small buffer against a single encounter.\n\nThat’s all it does—no damage, no extra effects, no concentration.

The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can’t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.  At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound’s attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.\nYour steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.\nWhen the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.\nWhile your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.\nYou can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.\n\nFind the Path\n6th-level divination\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools-such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes-worth 100 gp and an object from the location you wish to find)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 dayThis spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn’t specific (such as “a green dragon’s lair”), the spell fails.\nFor the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are\ntraveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.\n\nFind Traps\n2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight.

If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.  If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.  If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.\n\nFloating Disk\n1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)\nDuration: 1 hour This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.  The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.  If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.\n\nFly\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nFog Cloud\n1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 hourYou create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.\n\nForbiddance\n6th-level abjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time:10 minutes\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)\nDuration:1 dayYou create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the\ngatespell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the\nplane shiftspell.\nIn addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.\nThe spell’s area can’t overlap with the area ofanother\nforbiddancespell. If you cast forbiddance\nevery day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.\n\nForcecage\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 100 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 1 hour An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.  A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.  A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.  When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.  A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. This spell can’t be dispelled by dispel magic.\n\nForesight\n9th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)\nDuration: 8 hours You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target can’t be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.  This spell immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.\n\nFreedom of Movement\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)\nDuration:1 hourYou touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target’s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.\nThe target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically\nescape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target’s movement or attacks.\n\nFreezing Sphere\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:300 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)\nDuration:InstantaneousA frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.\nIf the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.\n"], "response": "**Flesh to Stone**  \n*2nd‑level transmutation*  \n*Casting time:* 1 action  \n*Range:* 60 ft.  \n*Components:* V, S, M (a small piece of stone)  \n*Duration:* 1 minute (concentration not required)\n\n**How the spell works**\n\nYou point at a creature you can see within 60 ft. and attempt to “mold” its flesh into stone.  \nThe creature must succeed on a **Dexterity saving throw** against your spell save DC.  \nIf it **fails** the save, it is **petrified** as if the 3rd‑level *petrify* spell had been cast on it, but the effect lasts only for the spell’s duration of 1 minute.  \n\nWhile petrified the creature:\n\n* is **incapacitated** (it can’t take actions or reactions)  \n* can’t move, speak, or otherwise act  \n* is effectively a statue: it takes no damage, its hit‑point total is unchanged, and it can be removed from its petrified state only by a successful saving throw (see below)  \n\nThe creature can **attempt a new Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns** (or whenever it takes a turn, if it’s not moving).  \nOn a **successful** saving throw it **returns to normal** and the spell ends.  \nIf the creature fails all of its attempts for the full minute, it remains petrified until the spell’s duration expires.

You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials. Creatures or magic items can’t be created or transmuted by this spell.

The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.

Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.

Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.\n\nGlyph of Warding\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 hour\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:Until dispelled or triggeredWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.  When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature.

Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.  Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.  The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.  As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.\n\nHallow\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 24 hours\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power.

Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.\nSecond, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls.

The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn’t affected.  While in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can’t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.

The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.  The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.\nDeities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is\nfree to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.\n\nGeas\n5th-level enchantment\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V\nDuration:30 daysYou place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you,\nit takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.\nYou can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.\nYou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A\nremove curse,greater restoration, or\nwishspell also ends it.\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.\n\nGentle Repose\n2nd-level necromancy (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse’s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)\nDuration: 10 days You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.  The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.\n\nGiant Insect\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.  Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.  A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.  The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.\n\nGlibness\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 hour Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.\n\nGlobe of Invulnerability\n6th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\nComponents:V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteAn immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.\nAny spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.\n\nGlyph of Warding\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time:1 hour\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:Until dispelled or triggeredWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.  When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.\n\nGoodberry\n1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)\nDuration: Instantaneous Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.  The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.\n\nGrease\n1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)\nDuration:1 minuteSlick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.\nWhen the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.\n\nGreater Invisibility\n4th-level illusion\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 minuteYou or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends.

You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.

You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects. Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.\nCorridors.

The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn’t affected. While in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces.

Gate 9th-level conjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration. The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal. Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains. When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you."], "response": "**Misty Cloud (5e – Elemental Evil Player’s Companion, 2nd‑level conjuration)**  \n> *You create a cloud of mist that can move with you. The cloud occupies a 5‑ft cube. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 necrotic damage. You can move through the cloud as a bonus action, but the cloud itself does not move unless you explicitly move it. The spell lasts 1 minute; you must maintain concentration.*\n\nBelow is a quick‑reference answer to the many “what‑if” questions you asked.  (If any part of the spell text is different in the edition you’re playing, the same principles apply.)\n\n| Question | How Misty Cloud treats it |\n|---|---|\n| **What happens to my gear?** | Your weapons, armor, and carried items are unaffected. The mist does not damage or alter objects. You can equip or unequip gear while inside the cloud. |\n| **Can I move?** | Yes. While you’re in the mist, you can move normally. In addition, the spell grants a *bonus action* to move the mist (and yourself) up to 30 ft in any direction. If you’re stunned or incapacitated, you can’t use that bonus action. |\n| **Can I attack?** | Yes. The mist does not provide cover that blocks attacks (unless another effect is present). You can attack normally as an action or bonus action. |\n| **Can I cast spells?** | Yes. The mist does not prevent spellcasting. Material components are handled the same way they normally are; if you have a component pouch or a focus, you can use it. The spell does not grant or deny any special casting benefits. |\n| **What if I get stunned or incapacitated?** | You still sit in the mist, but you lose all actions, bonus actions, and reactions. The mist doesn’t heal or protect you from those conditions. |\n| **What if I drop to 0 hp?** | As soon as you die, the spell ends (because concentration ends when you die). |\n| **Can the mist pass through holes or cracks?** | The mist is a 5‑ft‑cube “gas.” It can fill any space that is at least 5 ft wide and 5 ft tall. It will flow through any opening that meets those dimensions; otherwise it stays where it is. |\n| **How does it treat liquids?** | The mist is unaffected by water or other liquids; it simply sits in the air. It does not dissolve in or float on liquids. If the mist encounters a pool of water, it will just disperse over it. |\n| **Can it enter other creature’s space?** | The mist itself does not “occupy” a creature’s space; the caster can be in a creature’s space (as the spell doesn’t give the mist any special “occupancy” rules). The mist can be used to conceal the caster from other creatures, but it does not prevent the caster from moving through a creature’s space unless that creature is a normal creature and the rules say you can’t move through it. |\n| **Does it have any resistances or saving‑throw bonuses?** | No. The caster does not get any special resistances or advantage on saves. The only saving throw granted by the spell is the 2d8 necrotic‑damage saving throw that creatures in the mist must make. |\n| **Can it talk or manipulate objects?** | No. It is an effect, not an entity. It cannot use the ability to speak or manipulate objects. |\n| **Can it fall?** | The mist is a cloud of vapour; it has no weight or gravity, so it cannot fall. The caster inside the mist is subject to normal falling rules. |\n| **Does the spell end if I drop to 0 hp?** | Yes, because you lose concentration on death. |\n| **Are incorporeal creatures affected?** | Incorporeal creatures are still considered “creatures” for the purposes of the spell’s damage. They must still make the DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take the 2d8 necrotic damage. The mist does not provide any special immunity or interaction with incorporeal traits. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick recap for a DM or player\n\n* **Gear & actions** – Nothing changes; you can equip, attack, and cast normally.\n* **Movement** – Bonus action to move the mist (30 ft). No extra speed; the mist itself doesn’t push you.\n* **Damage** – Creatures that start a turn in the mist must Con‑save or take 2d8 necrotic damage. You’re immune to that damage because you’re the caster of the spell.\n* **End of spell** – When your concentration ends, the spell ends. You lose concentration on death, on taking 30+ damage, or when you finish your turn without the spell (if you are still concentrating but not casting again).\n* **Interaction with space** – The mist can occupy any 5‑ft‑cube in the air, and can move through openings that are 5 ft or larger. It does not “occupy” a creature’s space; you can still be in a creature’s space if you’re the caster.\n\nThat’s the whole of *Misty Cloud* in a nutshell.

To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.  Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.  A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.\n\nImprisonment\n9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target)\nDuration: Until dispelled You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range.

Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target.\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.\nBurial.The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere\nof magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.\n\nChaining.Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\nHedged Prison.The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\nMinimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\n\nSlumber.The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\nEnding the Spell.During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition\nis reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.

To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.  Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.

The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.

Immediate Effects on the Spell’s Duration\n\n* Because the spell’s duration is **instantaneous**, the clause “The target can’t regain hit points or hit‑point maximum until the end of the spell’s duration” has no ongoing effect beyond the instant.  \n* The hit‑point maximum stays reduced until an external effect restores it.\n\n### 5. Disease Interaction\n\n* If the target **has a disease** when the spell resolves, you may choose to **remove that disease** as part of the spell’s effect.  \n* Only **one disease** can be removed per casting.  \n* Removing the disease does **not** increase the target’s hit‑point maximum; it merely cures the affliction.  \n\n### 6. Death Condition\n\n* If the reduction brings the target’s hit‑point maximum to **0**, the spell ends and the creature **dies** immediately (regardless of whether the target still has positive hit points at the moment of reduction).  \n\n---\n\n#### Summary\n\n- **Damage**: 8d6 necrotic (modified by resistances/vulnerabilities).  \n- **Con save**: DC = 8 + prof + spellcasting mod; failure = incapacitated.  \n- **HP‑max reduction**: equals damage taken; permanent until healed.  \n- **Disease removal**: optional, one disease per casting.  \n- **Restoration**: any effect that restores hit‑point maximum (e.g., Greater Restoration, healing that restores max HP).  \n- **Death**: occurs if the HP‑max falls to 0.  \n\nThis covers the spell’s exact mechanical operation, how its hit‑point‑maximum reduction works, when and how the maximum can be restored, and its interaction with disease removal.", "reference": "Harm is a 6th‑level necromancy spell that requires a 1‑action casting time, a range of 60 feet, and verbal and somatic components.

The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action.

You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial.

Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.\nChoose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead.\nThe circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:\n•The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.\n•The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.\n•Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed,frightened, or possessed by the creature.When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nMagic Jar\n6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)\nDuration:Until dispelled\nYour body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell’s material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.  You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circlespell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.  Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.  Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.  While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.  If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies. When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.\n\nMagic Missile\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.\n\nMagic Mouth\n2nd-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:Until dispelledYou implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.\nWhen that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell,\nyou can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.\nThe triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.\n\nMagic Weapon\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 bonus action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.\n\nMagnificent Mansion\n7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration: 24 hours You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.  Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.  You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.\n\nMajor Image\n3rd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature\n(like a troglodyte’s stench).\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.

The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.\nThe information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language.

The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action.

If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.\n•The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.\n•Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed,frightened, or possessed by the creature.When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.\n\nMagic Jar\n6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:Self\nComponents:V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)\nDuration:Until dispelled\nYour body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell’s material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.  You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circlespell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.  Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.  Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.  While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.  If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies. When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.\n\nMagic Missile\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.\n\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.\n\nMagic Mouth\n2nd-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time:1 minute\nRange:30 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration:Until dispelledYou implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.\nWhen that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell,\nyou can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.\nThe triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.\n\nMagic Weapon\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time:1 bonus action\nRange:Touch\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.\n\nMagnificent Mansion\n7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration: 24 hours You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.  Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.  You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.\n\nMajor Image\n3rd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange:120 feet\nComponents:V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration:Concentration, up to 10 minutesYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature\n(like a troglodyte’s stench).\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\nAt Higher Levels.When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.\n\nMass Cure Wounds\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time:1 action\nRange:60 feet\nComponents:V, S\nDuration:InstantaneousA wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range.

Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nMass Healing Word\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked. If you choose a target that is held shut with arcane lock , that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally. When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.

{"user_input": "What are the implications of a character havin truesight in a world where darkness and magical obscurities abound, and how can a narrativeist use this ability to enrich the setting, create intrigue, and weave lore about ancient guardians or hidden truths that can be revealed only to those with truesight?", "reference_contexts": ["The Environment By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places. Falling A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall. Suffocating A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again. For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points. Vision and Light The most fundamental tasks of adventuring-noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few-rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance. A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. A heavily obscured area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix PH-A) when trying to see something in that area. The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness. Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius. Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light. Darknesscreates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness. Blindsight A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense. Darkvision Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Truesight A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane. Food and Water Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix PH-A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount. Food A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food. A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero. Water A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case. Interacting with Objects A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens. For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task. Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can.

Weaving Lore about Ancient Guardians / Hidden Truths\n\n1. **The “Guardians of the Veil”**  \n   - *Lore:* An ancient order of beings who kept the world from falling into magical oblivion. Their sanctuaries are hidden by illusion and darkness; only truesight can locate them.  \n   - *Narrative Use:* The party finds a map that leads to a “Veil Tower”; to reach it they need to solve puzzles that require seeing hidden runes.  \n   - *Conflict:* The guardians may distrust the truesight bearer if they suspect the bearer is an intruder.\n\n2. **The “Eternal Library of Luminara”**  \n   - *Lore:* A library that contains all truths of the world, locked behind layers of darkness. Truesight can see the true location of the library’s keys.  \n   - *Narrative Use:* The party receives a clue that only truesight can interpret, leading them to uncover forgotten history.  \n   - *Tension:* Other PCs may fear that the truesight bearer will reveal secrets that could destabilize power structures.\n\n3. **“The Hidden Truths of the First Dawn”**  \n   - *Lore:* A prophecy stating that only those with truesight can reveal the “First Dawn” – the original creation of the world.  \n   - *Narrative Use:* The truesight bearer is the key to unlocking a portal that holds the source of all magic.  \n   - *Moral Dilemma:* Do they use it to empower themselves, or share it with the world?  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Practical Storytelling Tips\n\n1. **Introduce Truesight Early, but Keep It Rare**  \n   - Give the character a limited number of uses or require a long rest, so every invocation feels meaningful.\n\n2. **Use Truesight to Reveal Hidden Story Layers**  \n   - Let the character see a hidden inscription that hints at a long‑lost civilization, prompting an investigative quest.\n\n3. **Make the Ability Socially Significant**  \n   - Others may question why the truesight bearer can see “through the darkness.” Use this to explore themes of truth versus perception.\n\n4. **Limit Over‑exposure**  \n   - Avoid making the ability a cheat for every encounter. Let the party still struggle with the unknown; truesight just gives them a *different* perspective.\n\n5. **Tie Truesight to World‑Changing Events**  \n   - Perhaps the truesight bearer can see the true nature of a magical storm, preventing a disaster that everyone else would ignore.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Quick “Plot Seeds”\n\n- **Hidden Entrance**: The party stumbles upon a crumbling gate. Truesight reveals that the door’s hinges are invisible; the gate is a portal to a secret vault that only truesight can see.  \n- **Illusionary Cult**: A cult appears as monks. Truesight shows their true form: statues that can move.  \n- **Ancient Sentinel**: A stone gargoyle that will only react when a truesight bearer steps near it.  \n- **Lost Chronicle**: A scroll that is magically “invisible” to everyone except those with truesight; the scroll contains the secret to defeating the final boss.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Truesight is more than a handy trick; it’s a narrative lever that can turn darkness into revelation, make hidden lore tangible, and inject a sense of wonder and tension into any campaign where shadows and secrets dominate. By using it sparingly, giving it weight, and connecting it to the world’s myths and mysteries, a DM can turn one character’s special sight into a catalyst for memorable adventures.", "reference": "A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual ilusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.

But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground-all considered difficult terrain.

Special Types of Movement Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go. Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed.

They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure. Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day. Short Rest A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below. Long Rest A longrest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest. A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits. Between Adventures Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold. In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion. Lifestyle Expenses Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle. Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty. Downtime Activities Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity. Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM. Crafting You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor. For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself. Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp. While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost. Practicing a Profession You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead."], "response": "### Short Rest (≈ 1 hour)\n\n| What you can do | How it works | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Spend Hit Dice** | For each Hit Die you spend, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to the result.

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day. Short Rest A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level.

When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can. You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height. object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks. A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.", "<2-hop>\n\nResting Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure. Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day. Short Rest A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below. Long Rest A longrest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity-the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest. A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits. Between Adventures Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold. In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion. Lifestyle Expenses Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle. Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty. Downtime Activities Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity. Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM. Crafting You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor. For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself. Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp. While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost. Practicing a Profession You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead."], "response": "**Short‑rest HP gains do not mechanically change terrain rules**\n\nIn 5 e the only rules that link a character’s “stamina” to the terrain are the optional *Exhaustion* rules (PHB p. 292) and the “Exhaustion” condition from combat.  The game does **not** provide a rule that a character’s current hit‑point total automatically raises or lowers the DC of an Athletics check, the cost of moving through difficult terrain, or the difficulty of climbing, crawling, or swimming.  The default rules are:\n\n| Action | Default DC | Movement cost |\n|--------|------------|---------------|\n| Climb (average wall) | 10 (Athletics) | 1 hp per 2 ft climbed, or 1 hp per 4 ft on a steep wall |\n| Crawl (normal) | – | Double movement |\n| Swim (normal) | – | Double movement |\n| Move through dense forest, rocky slope, etc. | – | Double movement |\n\nThese costs and DCs are set by the DM at the start of the encounter or journey, not by a character’s HP.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Using HP as a “stamina” modifier (home‑brew)\n\nSome DMs choose to treat a high HP total as an indicator of overall vigor and may:\n\n* **Raise the DC** for an Athletics check if the character is at low HP (e.g., add +2 to the DC for every 10 HP below max).\n* **Lower the DC** if the character is at full HP or above a threshold (e.g., subtract 1 from the DC for each 10 HP above 70 % of max).\n\nThis is a *home‑brew* mechanic and should be explained to the party before play.  It has no basis in the official rules, but it can add a sense of fatigue or endurance to a campaign.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Adjusting movement cost for a slippery vertical surface\n\nSimilarly, a DM might:\n\n* **Increase the movement cost** if a character is low on HP or exhausted (e.g., triple movement on a slick ledge).\n* **Decrease the cost** for a well‑conditioned character (e.g., allow half movement on the same surface).\n\nAgain, this is optional.  The official rules simply say that *moving through difficult terrain costs 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot of distance*, so any changes are entirely DM‑determined.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Implications for a party that is low on hit points\n\n| Situation | Effect on traversal |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| **Exhaustion** (from spending a lot of movement, climbing, etc.) | Adds a level of exhaustion, which imposes a –1 penalty to ability checks, saving throws, and AC; at level 4 it halves speed. |\n| **Low HP (no exhaustion)** | No mechanical penalty unless the DM applies a house‑rule.  The party may simply feel “tired” and be more prone to failing checks, but the rules do not impose a penalty. |\n| **Long journey** | If the party consistently pushes themselves without resting, the DM can: 1) impose the exhaustion rules, 2) add a fatigue “modifier” to the DCs, or 3) simply narrate that the characters are tired, perhaps requiring a longer rest to regain energy. |\n\n**Practical advice for a DM:**\n\n1. **Use the optional Exhaustion rules** to model stamina.  If a character spends a lot of movement or makes repeated Athletics checks, consider giving them a level of exhaustion.\n2. **Keep terrain DCs consistent** unless you have a compelling narrative reason to vary them.  If you do vary them, clearly explain why (e.g., a slippery ledge is slicker because the party is exhausted).\n3. **Encourage rest**.  A low‑HP party should be forced to take short or long rests more often, or risk falling into exhaustion or even dying from injuries sustained while struggling through difficult terrain.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Official rule:** HP does **not** influence terrain DCs or movement costs.  \n- **Home‑brew option:** A DM can tie HP (or exhaustion) to modified DCs or movement costs, but must state this clearly.  \n- **Implications:** A party low on HP is at higher risk of exhaustion if they keep pushing; without exhaustion, the rules impose no mechanical penalty, but the DM may narrate fatigue or adjust DCs as a house‑rule.", "reference": "During a short rest, a character can spend one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points. For each Hit Die spent, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier; the total is the number of hit points regained. This recovery can help a character maintain stamina while moving through difficult terrain, where each foot of movement costs double speed and climbing or swimming costs an extra foot per foot moved. The GM may require a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC of 10 to climb a slippery vertical surface or to clear a low obstacle. The character’s current hit points are not directly tied to the DC, but having more hit points allows the character to keep moving longer before needing another rest.", "answer_relevancy": 0.6593470318505242, "semantic_similarity": 0.37798893015500346, "bleu_score": 0.029799893137327636, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.13110539845758354, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.07858243451463791, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.3953488372093023}
{"user_input": "Wha are some Sample Traps?", "reference_contexts": ["Traps\nTraps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.  A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature.\nMechanical traps include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate.\nMagic traps are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.\n\nTraps in Play\nWhen adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.\n\nTriggering a Trap\nMost traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.\n\nDetecting and Disabling a Trap\nUsually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.  A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an\nIntelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.\nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic\ntrap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition,\ndispel magichas a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use\ndispel magic.\nIn most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.\nYou should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.\nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a\ntrapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.\nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.\n\nTrap Effects\nThe effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.  The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.  A trap intended to be a\nsetback is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a\ndangerous trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A\ndeadly trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.\n\nTrap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses\nTrap Danger  Save DC  Attack Bonus  \nSetback      10 - 11  +3 to +5      \nDangerous    12-15    +6 to +8      \nDeadly       16 - 20  +9 to +12     \n\n\nDamage Severity by Level\nCharacter Level  Setback  Dangerous  Deadly  \n1st-4th          1d10     2d10       4d10    \n5th-10th         2d10     4d10       10d10   \n11th - 16th      4d10     10d10      18d10   \n17th - 20th      10d10    18d10      24d10   \n\n\nComplex Traps\nComplex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.  When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.  For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.\n\nSample Traps\nThe magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.\n\nCollapsing Roof\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nAnyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.\nThe ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it’s in danger of collapse.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.\n\nFalling Net\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10\nStrength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.\n\nFire-Breathing Statue\nMagic trap This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.  The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.  The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.\n\nPits\nMechanical trap Four basic pit traps are presented here.\nSimple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.  The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).\nHidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.  A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.  When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.\nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the\narcane lockspell or similar magic.\nLocking Pit.This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.\nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In\nsome cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.\nSpiked Pit.This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the\npit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nPoison Darts\nMechanical trap\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.\nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8\nbonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nPoison Needle\nMechanical trap A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.  When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.  A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.\n\nRolling Sphere\nMechanical trap When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.  With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.  Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.\nThe sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.\nAs an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.\n\nSphere of Annihilation\nMagic trap\nMagical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a\nsphere of annihilation\nthat can’t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal\nsphere of annihilation\n.\nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the\nsympathyaspect of the antipathy/sympathy\nspell. A successful dispel magic(DC 18) removes this enchantment.\n"], "response": "Below is a quick‑reference list of **10 sample traps** that a Dungeon Master can drop into a 5e adventure.  \nFor each trap I give:\n\n| Element | What it is |\n|---------|------------|\n| **Trigger** | How the trap is sprung |\n| **Effect** | What happens (damage, status, etc.) |\n| **DC** | The most common way players must succeed to avoid or stop it |\n| **XP** | Roughly how many XP the DMG recommends for the trap’s difficulty |\n\n> **Tip:** All values are the *minimum* you’ll want to consider.

Trench of Acid\n\n| Trigger | A narrow pit lined with acid. |\n|---|---|\n| Effect | Anyone who falls into the pit or steps on the acid must succeed on a **Dexterity saving throw** (DC 14) or take **1d6 acid damage** per round. The pit is 3 ft deep, so a falling creature takes an extra **1d6 bludgeoning damage** on impact. |\n| DC | 14 |\n| XP | 25–45 |\n\n---\n\n## How to Use These Traps\n\n1. **Place them strategically**—in corridors, treasure rooms, or as a guard to a boss encounter.  \n2. **Adjust difficulty**: raise the DC or damage if the party is a level or two higher; lower it if the party is very young.  \n3. **Reward ingenuity**: if a player disarms or bypasses a trap, give a small XP bonus or a useful clue.  \n4. **Mix mundane and magical**: a purely mechanical trap can feel just as scary as a spell‑based one.  \n5. **Keep variety**: a single dungeon that only has falling rocks can feel repetitive. Combine at least two of the categories (mechanical, environmental, magical) to keep players on their toes.\n\nFeel free to tweak the numbers to suit your campaign’s balance and to match the environment where the trap appears.

One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.  A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature.\nMechanical traps include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate.\nMagic traps are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.\n\nTraps in Play\nWhen adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.\n\nTriggering a Trap\nMost traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.\n\nDetecting and Disabling a Trap\nUsually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.  A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an\nIntelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.\nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic\ntrap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition,\ndispel magichas a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use\ndispel magic.\nIn most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.\nYou should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.\nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a\ntrapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.\nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.\n\nTrap Effects\nThe effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.  The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.  A trap intended to be a\nsetback is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a\ndangerous trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A\ndeadly trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.\n\nTrap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses\nTrap Danger  Save DC  Attack Bonus  \nSetback      10 - 11  +3 to +5      \nDangerous    12-15    +6 to +8      \nDeadly       16 - 20  +9 to +12     \n\n\nDamage Severity by Level\nCharacter Level  Setback  Dangerous  Deadly  \n1st-4th          1d10     2d10       4d10    \n5th-10th         2d10     4d10       10d10   \n11th - 16th      4d10     10d10      18d10   \n17th - 20th      10d10    18d10      24d10   \n\n\nComplex Traps\nComplex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.  When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.  For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.\n\nSample Traps\nThe magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.\n\nCollapsing Roof\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nAnyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.\nThe ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it’s in danger of collapse.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.\n\nFalling Net\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10\nStrength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.\n\nFire-Breathing Statue\nMagic trap This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.  The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.  The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.\n\nPits\nMechanical trap Four basic pit traps are presented here.\nSimple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.  The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).\nHidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.  A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.  When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.\nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the\narcane lockspell or similar magic.\nLocking Pit.This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.\nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In\nsome cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.\nSpiked Pit.This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the\npit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nPoison Darts\nMechanical trap\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.\nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8\nbonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nPoison Needle\nMechanical trap A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.  When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.  A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.\n\nRolling Sphere\nMechanical trap When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.  With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.  Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.\nThe sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.\nAs an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.\n\nSphere of Annihilation\nMagic trap\nMagical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a\nsphere of annihilation\nthat can’t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal\nsphere of annihilation\n.\nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the\nsympathyaspect of the antipathy/sympathy\nspell. A successful dispel magic(DC 18) removes this enchantment.\n"], "response": "### Pit Traps in 5E – Rules, Flavor, and Creative Uses\n\nBelow is a quick‑reference guide that covers the four common pit‑trap variants you asked about (simple, hidden, locking, spiked), how to handle them in play, and how to turn them into memorable storytelling moments.\n\n| Pit Type | What It Is | How It Works | Trigger | DC to Detect | DC to Disarm / Disable | Damage / Effect |\n|----------|------------|--------------|---------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Simple Pit** | An open hole that a creature can fall into. | The trap simply drops the victim in a pit. | Floor plate, loose stone, or a “weak spot” on the floor. | 15 Perception or Investigation (or 10 if obvious). | 15 Investigation (or 10 if the pit is obvious). | Falling damage: 1d6 per 10 ft of depth (use DM’s rules). |\n| **Hidden Pit** | Same as a simple pit but concealed. | Floor is camouflaged by loose stones, slick moss, or a trapdoor that is flush with the surface. | Same triggers as above, but harder to see. | 20 Perception or Investigation. | 20 Investigation or 15 Thieves’ Tools (pick lock or cut rope). | Same falling damage as a simple pit. |\n| **Locking Pit** | A pit that’s sealed by a door, metal grate, or pressure‑plate‑locked trapdoor. | The pit is “locked” and won’t open until the lock is picked or a key is used. | Pressure plate, weight‑sensitive floor, or a key lock. | 20 Perception or Investigation (or 15 if the lock is obvious). | 20 Thieves’ Tools (pick lock) or a matching key. | Falling damage + any extra effect if the pit is spiked. |\n| **Spiked Pit** | A pit with spikes, spikes+spikes, or spikes that explode. | When a creature falls in, it is struck by spikes. | Same as above. | 15 Perception or Investigation. | 15 Investigation or 15 Thieves’ Tools (remove spikes). | 2d6 damage on the fall. If the pit is 20 ft deep, add 2d6 falling damage → total 4d6. (Adjust for depth.) |\n\n> **Note**: The DMG (p. 261) states a *spiked pit* deals *2d6* damage on a falling victim. The falling damage rule (DMG p. 196) applies as normal. You can increase the damage for a *large* or *huge* pit, or if the spikes are especially sharp, add an extra 1d6.\n\n---\n\n## How to Detect, Disable, or Avoid Pit Traps\n\n| Action | Check | Suggested DC | Notes |\n|--------|-------|--------------|-------|\n| **Spot** (look for irregular floor, loose stones) | Perception (or Investigation) | 15 (simple) / 20 (hidden) | If the DM says the trap is “well‑concealed” raise the DC by 5. |\n| **Search** (careful look or use of magic like *detect magic* if it’s a magical pit) | Investigation | 15–20 | Use tools to check for pressure plates or hidden seams. |\n| **Disable** (pick lock, cut rope, use a rope to hold the trapdoor closed) | Investigation + Thieves’ Tools | 15–20 | A *locking pit* can be opened with a key (no DC) or a lock pick (DC 20). |\n| **Avoid** (ranged attack, spell, or move off the trigger) | Advantage on the first roll (if you’re cautious) | – | A *simple pit* can be avoided by moving a foot or two off the trigger. |\n| **Escape** (if fallen in) | Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) | DC 15 (or higher if the pit is slippery, steep, or has spikes) | DM may rule a 30‑ft climb out or 10‑ft rope‑climb. |\n\n> **Tip**: The DM can let the pit be “disarmed” by removing spikes with a *mending* spell or a *thieves’ tools* check, adding flavor and giving the party a choice.\n\n---\n\n## Flavor & Narrative Ideas\n\n| Scenario | How the Pit Helps the Story | Creative Twist |\n|----------|----------------------------|----------------|\n| **Ancient Tomb** | The party is exploring a forgotten crypt. A *hidden pit* drops a skeleton into a *spiked pit* that reveals a buried treasure (the skeleton’s coffin). | The skeleton is actually a cursed NPC who can be freed if the party climbs out in time. |\n| **Castle Hallway** | A *locking pit* guards a secret door to the throne room. Only the royal family knows the key. | The key is hidden in a portrait that the players must decode. |\n| **Lava Caves** | A *spiked pit* that falls into molten rock. Falling in is death, but the pit can be triggered to drop a *portable magma* trap that the party can use as a fire source. | The magma has a chance to *ignite* the floor, creating a temporary walkway. |\n| **Forest Ruins** | A *simple pit* disguised as a mossy patch. An NPC warns “Don’t step on the broken stone.” | The “broken stone” is actually a *portal* to a forest spirit that can help the party. |\n| **Underground Mine** | A *hidden pit* is used by bandits to drop unsuspecting miners. | The bandits have a *guarded key*; the players can choose to steal it or negotiate. |\n\n### Using Pits as Puzzles\n\n1. **Crossing the Pit** – The party must use a rope, a bridge, or a magic spell to get across.  \n2. **Triggering the Trap** – Place a weight‑sensitive plate that the party can disarm by moving a heavy object off it.  \n3. **Multi‑Stage Traps** – A *locking pit* triggers a *spiked pit* underneath; the first fall opens a door that falls too.\n\n### Making Pits More Interesting\n\n* **Add a Theme**: Ice pit, acid pit, poison gas pit, or a *living pit* that moves or lures creatures.  \n* **Magic Interaction**: A *spiked pit* covered in *glyph of warding* that discharges a 3rd‑level spell when a creature falls.  \n* **Narrative Stakes**: The pit contains an *ancient artifact* that the party must retrieve or destroy.  \n* **Moral Dilemma**: The pit is the only way to rescue a trapped child, but triggering it might kill the child if they’re too small.  \n* **Environmental Hook**: Use weather or terrain to conceal or reveal the pit (e.g., a storm reveals a pit by washing away moss).  \n\n---\n\n## Quick‑Reference Cheat Sheet\n\n```\nTrap: Simple Pit\n- Detect: DC 15 Perception / Investigation\n- Disable: DC 15 Investigation\n- Damage: 1d6 per 10 ft depth\n\nTrap: Hidden Pit\n- Detect: DC 20 Perception / Investigation\n- Disable: DC 20 Investigation or 15 Thieves’ Tools\n- Damage: same as simple pit\n\nTrap: Locking Pit\n- Detect: DC 20 Perception / Investigation\n- Disable: 20 Thieves’ Tools (pick lock) or key\n- Damage: same as hidden pit + spiked damage if spiked\n\nTrap: Spiked Pit\n- Detect: DC 15 Perception / Investigation\n- Disable: DC 15 Investigation or 15 Thieves’ Tools (remove spikes)\n- Damage: 2d6 + falling damage\n```\n\n> **Remember**: These DCs are *suggestions*. Adjust them to fit your campaign’s difficulty level. The DMG’s “Trap” table (p. 261) is a great source for more exotic pits if you want to spice things up.\n\n---\n\n### Final Tips for the DM\n\n1. **Use the “Hidden” keyword** – If you say “hidden pit”, let the party know the floor looks “oddly smooth” or “there’s a patch of moss that looks out of place.”  \n2. **Give clues** – A cracked stone, a faint scent of something rotting, or a *glyph of warding* etched in the floor can hint at a trap.  \n3. **Reward careful play** – Spotting a pit early can let the party avoid death entirely, or set up a clever plan (e.g., dropping a rock on a pressure plate).  \n4. **Keep it balanced** – Pits are lethal but also simple; combine them with a way out (rope, ladder, spell) to keep combat fun.  \n5. **Narrative hook** – Use the pit to introduce an NPC, reveal lore, or give the players a tangible goal (retrieve an object, rescue someone).\n\nWith these rules, flavor, and narrative hooks, your pit traps will feel both mechanical and memorable. Happy dicing!", "reference": "Pits are a type of mechanical trap. There are four basic pit traps described. 1. Simple Pit – a hole in the ground covered by a large cloth that is camouflaged with dirt and debris. The DC to spot the pit is 10.

The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts. A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. Mechanical traps include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. Magic traps are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps. Traps in Play When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it. Triggering a Trap Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating."], "response": "**In D&D 5e, pulling a tripwire is basically the same as triggering any other trap.**  \nThe Dungeon Master (DM) decides what the wire is connected to, but the typical process is:\n\n| Step | What happens | Player actions | DM’s role |\n|------|--------------|----------------|-----------|\n| 1. Notice | A player may detect the wire on a Perception (or Investigation) check.  | **Roll**: Perception + Proficiency (if you’ve found a clue before). |  Gives a DC (usually 10–15) and a hint: “You see a thin blue line on the floor.” |\n| 2. Avoid or disarm | The player can try to sidestep or disarm the wire. | **Avoid**: Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to jump/roll over; **Disarm**: Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check. | Sets the DC (often 15 for disarm, 10–15 for avoid). If the check fails, the trap triggers. |\n| 3. Trigger | If the wire is pulled, the trap activates.  The DM announces the effect. |  |  |\n| 4. Consequence | Depends on the trap type: |\n|  - **Dart/arrow trap** | 1d6 damage, 10 ft range, maybe a DC 10 Dex save for half. |\n|  - **Spikes/pits** | 1d8–1d10 damage, falling damage, or a 10 ft drop. |\n|  - **Alarm** | 10 ft distant bell or a guard is alerted. |\n|  - **Environmental** | Fires, poison gas, a collapsing ceiling, etc. |\n| 5. Aftermath | The player may attempt a Disarm or Stop‑trap check again, or wait until it’s safe to move. |  |  |\n\n**Common DM guidelines**\n\n- **Notice DC**: 10–15 for a standard tripwire.  \n- **Avoid/Disarm DC**: 10–15, with *Thieves’ Tools* proficiency adding 3–5.  \n- **Damage**: Usually 1d4–1d8, unless the trap is a major one (see DMG p. 246–247).  \n- **Alarm**: If the trap includes an alarm, the DM may also announce that a guard is alerted or that a trapdoor opens elsewhere.\n\n**Example**  \nYour party crosses a hallway and someone on the back sees a thin blue line on the floor.  \n- **Perception check** (DC 12) → success, you notice the wire.  \n- **Thieves’ Tools check** (DC 13) → failure.  \n- The wire pulls: a dart trap fires, dealing 1d6 damage. The DM says, “A dart shoots from the wall, hitting your wizard for 4 damage. He must make a DC 10 Dex save for half.”  \n\nIf the wizard had disarmed the wire, the trap wouldn’t fire.\n\n**Bottom line:** Pulling a tripwire usually triggers whatever trap the DM has hidden—often a damage source, an alarm, or a combination. Always try to spot or avoid the wire before it’s pulled, and be ready for the trap’s consequences.", "reference": "Pulling a trip wire is a common trigger for traps, causing the trap to activate.", "answer_relevancy": 0.7666616435926036, "semantic_similarity": 0.4189129220478359, "bleu_score": 0.015506205886422778, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.05288461538461539, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.02743142144638404, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.7333333333333333}
{"user_input": "Could you explain, in a detailed step‑by‑step manner, how a character should use a Wisdom (Perception) check to detect a trap, including how the DC is determined, how passive perception can be used, and what happens if the check succeeds or fails, as described in the provided context?", "reference_contexts": ["Detecting and Disabling a Trap Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence. A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage. Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, dispel magichas a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use dispel magic. In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt. You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required. Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield. Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap."], "response": "### How a Character Detects a Trap with a Wisdom (Perception) Check  \n\nBelow is a step‑by‑step guide that covers everything a player needs to know:  \n* when to roll,  \n* how the DC is set,  \n* how passive Perception works, and  \n* what happens on success or failure.  \n\n---\n\n#### 1. **The DM Sets the Trap’s DC**\n\n1. **Choose the Trap Type** – The DM decides what kind of trap it is (e.g., spring‑loaded spike, pressure‑plate that triggers a poison gas, magical rune that summons a creature).  \n2. **Reference the DMG (or relevant source)** – Table 10‑3, “Trap Difficulty,” in *Dungeon Master’s Guide* gives typical DCs (e.g., “Simple trap” DC 10, “Common trap” DC 15, “Uncommon trap” DC 20, “Very uncommon trap” DC 25, “Rare trap” DC 30).  \n3. **Add or Subtract Modifiers** –  \n   * The DM may raise the DC if the trap is particularly well‑concealed or magically hidden.  \n   * The DM may lower the DC if the trap is obvious, the area is highly lit, or the party has high Perception already.  \n4. **Communicate the DC** – The DM tells the players *“The trap’s DC is 18.”* (They may say this only when a player attempts to detect it, or they may keep it secret if the trap is truly hidden.)\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **The Player Makes the Check**\n\n| What the player does | How to calculate |\n|----------------------|------------------|\n| **Active Perception** | Roll `d20 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency bonus` (if proficient with Perception). |\n| **Passive Perception** | `10 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency bonus` – this is the number the DM uses automatically unless the player is actively searching. |\n\n*Example:*  \n- Wisdom 14 (+2)  \n- Proficiency bonus +2 (if proficient)  \n- Active roll: `d20 + 2 + 2`  \n- Passive: `10 + 2 + 2 = 14`\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Compare to the DC**\n\n- **Success**: Roll (or passive) **≥ DC**.  \n- **Failure**: Roll < DC.  \n\n---\n\n#### 4. **What Happens on Success**\n\n1. **Trap Is Discovered** – The DM describes what the character sees: “You notice a faint, almost invisible seam on the floor; a pressure plate that will trigger a spike.”  \n2. **Options for the Player**  \n   * **Disarm** – Use the *Disarm a Trap* rules (or a rogue’s *Thief’s Tools*).  \n   * **Avoid** – Move carefully, use a different route, or cast *Detect Magic* to see if the trap is magical.  \n   * **Counter‑measure** – Lay a rope, use a *Bardic Performance* to distract, etc.  \n3. **No Immediate Consequences** – Since the trap is known, it can be neutralized before being triggered.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **What Happens on Failure**\n\n1. **Trap Remains Hidden** – The character does not see the trap.  \n2. **Trigger Conditions Apply** – If the character moves over the trigger (e.g., a pressure plate) or performs an action that activates it, the trap engages.  \n3. **DM Resolves the Trap** – Apply the trap’s effect per its description (damage, status, environmental hazard).  \n4. **Optional Rerolls** – Some DMs allow a *secondary check* after a failure (e.g., after a trap triggers, the character might attempt a new Perception check to see if the trap is still present or has been revealed by the damage). This is not a rule but a DM choice.  \n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Using Passive Perception Effectively**\n\n- **When the DM Says “Passive Perception”**  \n  * The DM uses the character’s passive Perception to decide if the character would notice the trap *without actively looking*.  \n  * If the passive score **≥ DC**, the trap is detected automatically.  \n  * If the passive score **< DC**, the character fails to notice it.\n\n- **When to Ask for Passive**  \n  * The DM often asks: “Are you actively looking for traps?”  \n  * If *no*, they apply passive.  \n  * If *yes*, the player rolls a Perception check.\n\n- **Stacking Passive with Active**  \n  * If the DM says the character “spends an action actively searching,” the player rolls a Perception check.  \n  * If the character “spends the whole day sweeping the area,” the DM might give them a bonus to passive or a separate roll.\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Common Variations and House‑Rules**\n\n| Scenario | Typical DM Action |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| **A trap is magically concealed** | Add +5 or more to DC; consider *Detect Magic* or *Perception* against a higher DC. |\n| **The trap is a hidden magical rune** | The trap’s DC may be set against the *spell DC* of the rune, not a standard trap DC. |\n| **Multiple traps in one area** | The DM might require a *Perception* check per trap or a single check that covers the whole area. |\n| **Player uses a tool (Thieves’ Tools)** | They can add a tool proficiency bonus to the check. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Recap\n\n1. **DM sets a DC** (based on trap type and concealment).  \n2. **Player rolls** (or uses passive) `d20 + Wis + proficiency` if proficient.  \n3. **Success** → Trap discovered; player can disarm or avoid.  \n4. **Failure** → Trap remains hidden; if triggered, the trap’s effect applies.  \n5. **Passive Perception** is used automatically when the character isn’t actively searching.\n\nThat’s the full, rule‑based process for detecting traps with Wisdom (Perception) in D&D 5e. Happy hunting!", "reference": "1. Identify the trap’s description in the adventure text; the description will list the DC that must be met or exceeded to detect the trap.\n2. Decide whether the character will actively look for the trap. If so, the character makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\n3. Roll the Wisdom (Perception) check and compare the result to the trap’s DC. If the roll is equal to or higher than the DC, the character successfully detects the trap.\n4. If the character does not actively look, the Dungeon Master can compare the trap’s DC to each party member’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score. If a passive score meets or exceeds the DC, that character notices the trap while passing by.\n5. If the check succeeds, the adventurers know the trap’s presence before it is triggered. They can then attempt to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it, or take other precautions.\n6. If the check fails, the trap remains hidden until it is triggered or until another action reveals it.\n7. In some cases, a character’s action can reveal the trap without a check. For example, lifting a rug that conceals a pressure plate immediately shows the trigger, so no Wisdom (Perception) check is required.\n8. Once a trap is detected, the description may also specify additional checks (such as Intelligence (Investigation) or Dexterity with thieves’ tools) needed to disarm it, but the initial detection is handled by the Wisdom (Perception) check or passive perception as outlined above.", "answer_relevancy": 0.8130725231745547, "semantic_similarity": 0.4773610820234965, "bleu_score": 0.09194540939657105, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.17175572519083968, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.11349306431273644, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.35294117647058826}

Cantrips You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table. Spell Slots The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. Eldritch Invocations In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. Pact Boon At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice. Pact of the Chain You learn the find familiarspell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. Pact of the Blade You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. Pact of the Tome Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

Each boon gives the DM and the player a ready‑made way to explore that relationship, its expectations, its stakes, and its consequences. Below are the core narrative opportunities for each of the three standard boons.**\n\n| Boon | Core Mechanic | Narrative Hooks | Example Story Beats |\n|------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| **Pact of the Chain** | Grants a *Familiar* (usually *Imp, Quasit, Sprite, etc.) | 1. **Messenger / Spy** – the familiar can infiltrate places the warlock cannot. <br>2. **Vessel of the Patron** – the patron may use the familiar as a conduit, delivering cryptic messages or visions. <br>3. **Moral Test** – the familiar could betray the warlock or act against the patron’s wishes. | *The familiar warns of an approaching cult.* <br>*The patron asks the familiar to seduce a political figure; the warlock must decide whether to comply.* <br>*The familiar acts independently, revealing the patron’s darker motives.* |\n| **Pact of the Blade** | Allows the warlock to summon a *weapon* that is an extension of the pact. | 1. **Living Weapon** – the blade can act autonomously, sometimes demanding tribute or speaking in the patron’s voice. <br>2. **Combat Partnership** – the warlock’s prowess is tied to the weapon’s will, creating tension in battle. <br>3. **Identity Shift** – the warlock may be perceived as a “weapon of the patron,” blurring personal agency. | *In a duel, the blade speaks of the patron’s demands.* <br>*The warlock’s blade refuses to strike a particular target, hinting at the patron’s true agenda.* <br>*The warlock must choose between using the blade to save allies or to serve the patron’s hidden plan.* |\n| **Pact of the Tome** | Grants a *Book of Shadows* filled with new invocations and knowledge. | 1. **Forbidden Knowledge** – the tome can reveal secrets about the patron’s nature or past. <br>2. **Research Tool** – the warlock can hunt lore that may lead to the patron’s true location or motives. <br>3. **Corruption Risk** – the book may contain dangerous spells that tempt the warlock toward the patron’s darker path. | *The warlock finds an invocation that can summon the patron’s avatar.* <br>*While studying an ancient rite, the warlock learns the patron’s true identity is a dying deity.* <br>*A spell from the tome accidentally awakens a long‑suppressed evil that the patron wants to use.* |\n\n### How the Boon Shapes the Relationship\n\n1. **Proof of Favor or Test**  \n   - The boon is a tangible sign the patron has chosen the warlock—either as a trusted ally or as a proving ground.  \n   - The warlock must prove worthiness by using the boon responsibly or, conversely, can be punished if the boon is misused.\n\n2. **Channel of Communication**  \n   - The familiar or the weapon can act as a mouthpiece, sending messages that feel personal yet still distant.  \n   - The Book of Shadows can transmit dreams or memories that feel like the patron speaking directly to the warlock.\n\n3. **Shared Consequences**  \n   - Actions taken with the boon affect the patron’s standing. A blade’s refusal can anger a patron, while a familiar’s betrayal can lead to a curse.  \n   - The warlock’s moral choices with the boon shape the patron’s perception, potentially opening new quests or closing old ones.\n\n4. **Narrative Tension & Growth**  \n   - The boon creates recurring questions: “Will the warlock keep using the familiar to spy on the patron?” “Will the weapon’s will overtake the warlock’s?” “Will the knowledge from the tome tempt the warlock into the patron’s ideology?”  \n   - These tensions give the warlock arc points: loyalty vs. autonomy, curiosity vs. danger, service vs. self‑preservation.\n\n### Quick “Hook Ideas” for Each Boon\n\n| Boon | Hook |\n|------|------|\n| Chain | The familiar discovers a hidden doorway to the patron’s sanctum; the warlock must decide whether to enter. |\n| Blade | The summoned blade demands a sacrifice to fully unleash its power—does the warlock give in? |\n| Tome | A forgotten spell in the tome reveals the patron’s true form; the warlock must choose whether to reveal this to allies. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The Pact Boon is a narrative lever.

The AC you use is the normal AC for that type of armor. |\n\n### How it works in practice\n\n1. **Attunement** – A creature that can use the *Shadow Step* spell (or a character who wants the advantage on Stealth checks) must attune to the armor. This takes a short rest.\n2. **Stealth** – While in dim light or darkness, you automatically roll with advantage on Stealth checks. No spell or special action is required.\n3. **Shadow Step use** – When you choose to use *Shadow Step*, you spend a bonus action. You can only do this once per long rest. You need to be in dim light or darkness, and you must be able to see the destination space. Once the spell resolves, you are in that new space and may use the benefit of being in a shadowy area immediately afterward.\n\n### Quick recap\n\n- **Advantage** on Stealth in dim light/darkness **all the time** while wearing.\n- **One free use** of *Shadow Step* (30 ft teleport to a shadowy spot) **per long rest**; it uses a bonus action.\n- No extra AC bonus beyond the armor’s normal value.\n\nIf your DM has a variant text or if you’re playing a different edition, let me know and I can adjust the explanation.", "reference": "You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.", "answer_relevancy": 0.844684259562249, "semantic_similarity": 0.303797595217724, "bleu_score": 0.008548570083745205, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.05357142857142857, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.02821316614420063, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.5294117647058824}

Cantrips You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table. Spell Slots The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. Eldritch Invocations In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. Pact Boon At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice. Pact of the Chain You learn the find familiarspell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. Pact of the Blade You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. Pact of the Tome Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

All slots in the pool are the same level (the highest level the Warlock can cast).  \n2. **Cast from the pool** – To cast any warlock spell, you expend one slot from this pool. You can’t use other classes’ spell slots to cast warlock spells, and vice‑versa.  \n3. **Slot level vs. spell level** – You may cast a spell whose level is *≤* the slot level, just like any other spellcaster.  \n4. **Short‑rest recovery** – All slots in the pool are fully restored after a **short rest** (≈1‑hour break). Long rests restore them automatically too, but the short‑rest rule is what makes Warlocks unique.  \n5. **Cantrips** – Cantrips are not limited by slots; they can be cast at will, just like for other classes.  \n6. **Invocations** – The Warlock can enhance or modify their spells (or cantrips) with Eldritch Invocations. Some invocations let you cast certain spells without expending a slot (e.g., *Pact of the Tome* + *Book of Shadows*).\n\n### Key differences from other classes\n\n| Feature | Warlock (Pact Magic) | Other spellcasters |\n|---------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| **Slot regeneration** | Short rest | Long rest (and sometimes short rest for specific subclasses, e.g., Sorcerer’s *Metamagic*) |\n| **Number of slots** | Very few, but high level quickly | More slots, but all levels are spread out |\n| **Slot level uniformity** | All slots in pool are same level | Each level has its own set of slots |\n| **Spell list** | Warlock’s own list (plus some via *Book of Shadows*) | Each class has its own list |\n| **Cantrips** | Unlimited | Unlimited |\n\n### Quick example\n\nA 7th‑level Warlock has **3 slots** of **3rd‑level**.  \n- On a short rest, those 3 slots are replenished.  \n- They can cast *Fireball* (3rd‑level), *Charm Person* (2nd‑level), *Eldritch Blast* (cantrip), *Hex* (1st‑level), etc., using the slots accordingly.  \n- After using all 3 slots, they need another short rest to regain them.  \n- They can still cast *Eldritch Blast* as many times as they want because cantrips don’t use slots.\n\n**Bottom line:** Pact Magic is a compact, high‑level spell‑casting system that gives Warlocks powerful spells that recharge quickly on short rests, while limiting the number of times they can use them each day.", "reference": "Pact Magic is the warlock's spellcasting feature. You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table. Spell slots are shown in the Warlock table and all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd‑level spell slots. To cast the 1st‑level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd‑level spell.

Otherworldly Patrons The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals. The Fiend You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths. Expanded Spell List The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. Fiend Expanded Spells Spell Level Spells 1st burning hands, command 2nd blindness/deafness, scorching ray 3rd fireball, stinking cloud 4th fire shield, wall of fire 5th flame strike, hallow Dark One’s Blessing Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1). Dark One’s Own Luck Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Fiendish Resilience Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance. Hurl Through Hell Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Your Pact Boon Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature. Pact of the Chain. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar.

It lists the core Fiend patron features, the *Thief*‑specific abilities, the expanded spell list that the patron adds, and the invocations that are unique to the *Thief* line.  At the end is a short play‑style guide that explains how those elements combine in combat and in story.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Fiend Patron Features (Unchanged)\n\n| Level | Feature | Effect |\n|-------|---------|--------|\n| 1 | **Dark One’s Blessing** | When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level. |\n| 1 | **Fury of the Fiend** | At 1st level, you add your Charisma modifier to the damage of any hit you land with a pact weapon. |\n| 6 | **Fiendish Resilience** | You gain resistance to fire damage. |\n| 10 | **Fiendish Vigor** | You can use a reaction to add your Charisma modifier to a saving throw you’re failing, once per short rest. |\n| 14 | **Fiendish Legacy** | Choose one damage type (fire, radiant, necrotic, poison, or psychic). You deal extra damage of that type equal to your Charisma modifier on any damage you deal. |\n\n> *Note:* All of the above stack with the *Thief* features unless a rule specifically says otherwise.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Thief of Five Fates Features\n\n| Level | Feature | How it works |\n|-------|---------|--------------|\n| 1 | **Fate’s Blessing** | **(bonus action)** Grant advantage on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw for yourself or a creature you can see. Once per short rest. |\n| 6 | **Fate’s Guidance** | **(reaction)** Reroll a failed attack roll, ability check, or saving throw once per short rest. |\n| 10 | **Fate’s Bargain** | **(action)** Trade advantage for disadvantage or vice‑versa on a single roll. Once per short rest. |\n| 14 | **Fate’s Favor** | **(reaction)** Roll a d4 and add it to any damage roll you make or subtract it from any damage you take. Once per short rest. |\n\n> *All of the above are separate from the Fiend’s own bonuses; you can use them in addition to the Fiend’s features on the same turn.*\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Once per long rest. |\n\n> *Invocations are optional; you may mix and match them with the standard warlock invocations.*\n\n---\n\n## 5. How These Pieces Interact\n\n### Combat‑Tactical Overview\n\n| Element | What it Gives you in Combat |\n|---------|----------------------------|\n| **Fiend’s Fury** | Extra Charisma damage on melee attacks (or pact weapon). |\n| **Fiend’s Legacy** | Choose a damage type to amplify (fire, radiant, etc.). |\n| **Fate’s Blessing** | Quick advantage boost on key rolls—great for closing the gap on a hit or saving a spell. |\n| **Fate’s Guidance** | A safety net for a single failed roll—perfect for high‑stakes saves or crucial attack rolls. |\n| **Fate’s Bargain** | Tactical trade‑off: if you’re in a tough spot, you can give a foe a disadvantage or yourself one. |\n| **Fate’s Favor** | A last‑minute tweak to damage or damage mitigation—can swing a battle or save a life. |\n| **Expanded Spells** | Access to a broad range of control and healing spells (*Bless, Cure Wounds, Fireball, Wall of Force, etc.*) that supplement the Fiend’s fire‑focused list. |\n| **Invocations** | Gives you extra versatility—ability checks, additional damage, or control over fate on a single roll. |\n\n**Typical combat routine**:  \n1. **Start of turn** – Use *Fate’s Blessing* (bonus action) on an ally’s attack roll or your own.  \n2. **Action** – Cast *Fireball* or *Bless* (if you have an enemy spellcaster).  \n3. **Reactions** – Use *Fate’s Favor* (if a huge hit lands or you take a big blow).  \n4. **Bonus action** – If you’re below 50 % HP, use *Dark One’s Blessing* after a kill.  \n5. **End of turn** – Activate *Fury of the Fiend* for extra damage on melee swings.\n\n### Role‑Playing Hooks\n\n| Feature | Narrative Angle |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| **Fiend Patron** | Your pact is with a fiery, contract‑binding entity. The fiend demands power and offers fire‑based cruelty. |\n| **Thief of Five Fates** | Your patron is a trickster who loves to bend fate—your warlock feels like a pawn and a master at once. |\n| **Fate’s Blessing / Guidance** | You can say, “The threads of destiny favor me today.” or “The fates are cruel, but I can bend them.” |\n| **Fate’s Bargain / Favor** | You might negotiate with your patron: “I’ll give you a chance to change a roll in exchange for a favor.” |\n| **Expanded Spells** | The warlock can heal allies (Cure Wounds) or protect them (Bless, Freedom of Movement). It shows the warlock’s cunning beyond fire. |\n| **Invocations** | Each invocation can be a signature move—e.g., “With the Thief’s Luck, I turn the tide.” |\n\n> **Story‑building idea:** The fiend’s pact is *strict* (it wants souls), but the *Thief* urges you to manipulate the fates of those souls, perhaps to bargain for mercy or to play a higher game. Your warlock can become a master of fate‑based traps, a negotiator with the fiend, or an agent who flips the fates of entire factions.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick Reference Table (What a Player Sees)\n\n| Level | Fiend Features | Thief Features | Expanded Spells (choose) | Invocations (choose) |\n|-------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| 1 | Dark One’s Blessing, Fury of the Fiend | Fate’s Blessing | 1st‑level spells (Bliss, Cure Wounds, Detect Magic) | Thief’s Insight, Thief’s Luck |\n| 3 | — | — | — | — |\n| 6 | Fiendish Resilience | Fate’s Guidance | 2nd‑level spells (Aid, Lesser Restoration) | — |\n| 10 | Fiendish Vigor | Fate’s Bargain | 3rd‑level spells (Dispel Magic, Fireball) | — |\n| 14 | Fiendish Legacy | Fate’s Favor | 4th‑level spells (Freedom of Movement, Greater Restoration) | — |\n| 18 | — | — | 5th‑level spells (Raise Dead, Wall of Force) | — |\n| 20 | — | — | 6th‑level spells (Magic Jar, Mass Suggestion) | — |\n\n> *You can mix and match invocations, and you can choose any spell from either expanded list when you gain a new spell slot.*\n\n---\n\n## 7. Bottom Line for Your Campaign\n\n* **Combat:** The Fiend gives you raw firepower and resilience, while the Thief adds a layer of tactical flexibility through fate‑manipulation. You can hit hard, heal, and dodge, all while having a few “fate‑based” tricks to turn the tide.\n\n* **Role‑Play:** Your character is a double‑agent: loyal to a cruel fiend but also a clever trickster who can bend fate to the warlock’s will. This makes for great conflict with NPCs who question where your true loyalty lies, and it offers the DM a built‑in mechanic for “fate” twists in the story.\n\nFeel free to tweak the limits on short/long rest usage if you want the warlock to feel more or less powerful.

At 1st level the Fiend grants an expanded spell list that includes burning hands, command, blindness/deafness, scorching ray, fireball, stinking cloud, fire shield, wall of fire, flame strike, hallow, and the special ability Dark One’s Blessing. Dark One’s Blessing gives temporary hit points equal to the warlock’s Charisma modifier plus warlock level whenever a hostile creature is reduced to 0 hit points. At 6th level the warlock can use Dark One’s Own Luck to add a d10 to an ability check or saving throw once per short or long rest. At 10th level the Fiend allows the warlock to choose a damage type for resistance, which can be changed after a short rest; this resistance is ignored by magical or silver weapons. At 14th level the warlock can use Hurl Through Hell to transport a target through the lower planes, dealing 10d10 psychic damage to non‑fiends and returning them after the next turn. The Fiend also provides a special Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain gives a familiar that can be a reflection of the patron, Pact of the Blade gives a weapon that could be an axe of black metal with flames, and Pact of the Tome gives a book bound in demon hide with forbidden lore. These features are complemented by the Thief of Five Fates invocations and features. The Thief of Five Fates allows the warlock to cast bane once per long rest, to attack with a pact weapon twice when taking the Attack action at 5th level (Thirsting Blade), to cast arcane eye at will at 15th level (Visions of Distant Realms), to communicate telepathically with a familiar and perceive through its senses at 15th level (Voice of the Chain Master), to cast speak with dead at will at 9th level (Whispers of the Grave), and to see the true form of shapechangers or illusion‑concealed creatures within 30 feet at 15th level (Witch Sight). When a warlock has a Fiend patron, all of these Thief of Five Fates features stack with the patron’s abilities, allowing the warlock to combine the Fiend’s fire‑based spell options, damage resistances, and planar transport with the Thief’s unique invocations that enhance combat versatility, information gathering, and role‑playing opportunities.

Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. Spellbook At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar). Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

What is an Arcane Tradition?\n\nAn **Arcane Tradition** is a wizard’s subclass (a “school of magic”) that you choose when you reach **2nd level**.  \nIt is the wizard’s equivalent of a fighter’s archetype or a rogue’s subclass.  \nEach tradition gives you a set of unique abilities that:\n\n* Enhance or modify how you cast spells  \n* Grant new spell‑casting options (new spells, additional spell slots, new spell‑related features)  \n* Provide mechanical benefits that grow as you level (at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels).  \n\nThe choice is permanent—once you pick a tradition, you can’t switch to another.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How to pick one\n\n| Step | What to do |\n|------|------------|\n| **a.** | When you hit 2nd level, look at the *Arcane Tradition* options available in the sourcebooks you own (PHB, Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, etc.). |\n| **b.** | Pick one.  The first time you pick a tradition you gain its 2nd‑level feature. |\n| **c.** | From that point forward you keep that tradition, and you’ll gain its 6th‑, 10th‑, and 14th‑level features as you reach those levels. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. What you get at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th levels\n\nBelow is a quick‑reference table for the eight PHB Arcane Traditions.  (Tasha’s and other books add more schools; they follow the same pattern of one feature per level.)\n\n| Arcane Tradition | 2nd‑Level Feature | 6th‑Level Feature | 10th‑Level Feature | 14th‑Level Feature |\n|------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| **Abjuration** | **Arcane Ward** – create a magical shield that absorbs damage and is replenished by expended spell slots. | **Ward Evocation** – you can use your ward to absorb damage from evocation spells you cast. | **Ward Spells** – you can add non‑evocation spells to your ward’s protection. | **Ward of the Abjurer** – you can trigger a protective effect (e.g., a burst of force) when a creature hits you. |\n| **Conjuration** | **Benign Transposition** – use a 1st‑level conjuration spell to teleport yourself. | **Ready Spell** – when you use the ready action, you can cast a conjuration spell without expending a slot. | **Summon Familiar** – you can summon a familiar at any time, without spending a slot. | **Conjuration Mastery** – your conjuration spells are half the level of the slot you use. |\n| **Divination** | **Guiding Eye** – see through a conjuration or divination spell you cast, gaining a bonus on the spell’s DC. | **Third Eye** – gain a 2nd‑level divination spell to use once per long rest. | **Misty Step** – you can cast *Misty Step* once per long rest. | **Scrying** – you can cast *Scrying* without a material component, and you can cast it twice per long rest. |\n| **Enchantment** | **Hypnotic Gaze** – a creature can’t use reactions against you until the end of its next turn. | **Sage’s Insight** – you can add a 2nd‑level enchantment spell to your spell list and use it without a slot once per long rest. | **Enchanter’s Presence** – when you deal damage to a creature with a spell, it must succeed on a saving throw or be charmed until the end of its next turn. | **Enchantment Mastery** – when you cast a spell that affects one creature, you can target an additional creature within the same range. |\n| **Evocation** | **Evocation Savant** – reduce the gold and time cost of evocation spells; **Sculpt Spells** – you can exclude a creature from the area of an evocation spell you cast. | **Potent Cantrip** – your evocation cantrips deal extra damage. | **Empowered Evocation** – you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage of your evocation spells. | **Lasting Spells** – you can double the duration of your evocation spells. |\n| **Illusion** | **Eye of Illusion** – you can create a 1‑foot‑diameter illusion that lasts 1 minute, and you can see through it as a free action. | **Illusory Disguise** – you can use a 1st‑level illusion spell as a bonus action without expending a slot. | **Illusory Terrain** – you can create an illusion that covers a 20‑by‑20‑foot area as a bonus action. | **Illusion Mastery** – you can cast *Invisibility* on a creature you can see, and the spell lasts twice as long. |\n| **Necromancy** | **Grim Harvest** – when you kill a creature with a spell, you regain a number of hit points equal to the spell’s level. | **Undead Thralls** – when you kill a creature with a spell, you can animate it as a zombie or skeleton for a limited time. | **Reaper’s Touch** – add necrotic damage to necromancy spells you cast, and you can regain hit points when a creature you damage dies. | **Undead Thralls (again)** – you can now create additional undead (e.g., a ghoul) as a bonus action once per long rest. |\n| **Transmutation** | **Minor Alchemy** – you can create minor magical effects (e.g., a 1‑minute *light* spell) for free. | **Transmutation Mastery** – you can cast *Enlarge/Reduce* without expending a spell slot. | **Transmuted Form** – you can turn a creature into a harmless animal or object for 1 minute as a bonus action. | **Transmuting Mastery** – you can transform a creature into a larger or smaller form, and you can cast *Polymorph* as a bonus action once per long rest. |\n\n> **Tip:** When you look at a tradition’s table, the 2nd‑level column always gives the feature you pick at 2nd level. The other columns are the features that unlock as you level.\n\n---\n\n### 4. How they affect wizard progression\n\n* **Spell‑casting power** – many traditions give you extra damage, extra spell slots, or the ability to recast spells without a slot (e.g., Evocation’s *Potent Cantrip* or Necromancy’s *Reaper’s Touch*).  \n* **Utility** – some traditions grant new spells or allow you to use certain spells for free (e.g., Conjuration’s *Benign Transposition*, Illusion’s *Eye of Illusion*).  \n* **Defensive options** – Abjuration’s ward and Enchantment’s *Hypnotic Gaze* give you ways to protect yourself or control enemies.  \n* **Control over enemies** – many traditions provide ways to charm, dominate, or otherwise manipulate foes (Enchantment, Illusion, Necromancy).  \n\nChoosing an Arcane Tradition tailors your wizard’s role in the party—whether you want to be a damage dealer, a battlefield controller, a defensive “shield”, or a support caster. Pick one that fits the style you enjoy, and let the level‑up features enhance it.\n\n---", "reference": "An Arcane Tradition is a special path you choose for your wizard when you reach 2nd level.

The book is separate from the wizard’s *known* spells; you only prepare a subset of the book each day. |\n| **Cantrips** | 0‑level spells that never use a slot.  Wizards get 2 cantrips at 1st level. |\n| **Spells known** | 1st‑level spells you can prepare.  Wizards start with 2 known 1st‑level spells. |\n| **Spellbook contents** | 1st‑level wizard spells you’ve copied.  At 1st level you begin with 6 1st‑level spells in the book (these are the spells you can add to your “known” list). |\n\n---\n\n## 2.

How to cast a spell\n\n1. **Choose a prepared spell** from your list (you can’t cast spells not in your spellbook).  \n2. **Use a spell slot** of the spell’s level or higher (or a ritual, if the spell has the ritual tag).  \n3. **Deliver components** (verbal, somatic, material).  A spellcasting focus (e.g., wand, staff, component pouch) can replace any non‑costly material component.  \n4. **Spend the required action** (or bonus action/reaction if the spell says so).  \n5. **Roll any saving throw or attack roll** as the spell requires, using the DC/attack modifier above.  \n6. **Apply the spell’s effect** (damage, healing, status, etc.).  \n7. **Track spell‑slot use** – you lose the slot unless you recover it with Arcane Recovery or a similar feature.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Ritual casting\n\n* A spell with the **ritual** tag can be cast as a ritual, taking **10 extra minutes** and **no spell slot**.  \n* You must still have the spell in your spellbook and the spell must be prepared to cast it as a ritual (unless the DM allows “ritual only” cast‑on‑the‑spot, which is rare).  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Using a focus\n\n* Any **non‑costly material component** can be replaced by a focus that’s appropriate for your class.  \n  * Wizards typically use a **component pouch** or a **wand/staff/rod**.  \n* If you use a focus, you don’t need to keep the material component on hand; just keep the focus with you.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Learning new spells\n\n1. **Find a spell** (e.g., from a scroll, other wizard’s spellbook, or a spell‑casting encounter).  \n2. **Copy it** into your spellbook:  \n   * **Time**: 1 hour per spell level (1 h for 1st‑level, 2 h for 2nd‑level, etc.).  \n   * **Cost**: 10 gp × spell level (i.e., 10 gp for a 1st‑level spell).  \n   * **Requirements**: A spellbook and a basic understanding of the spell’s mechanics.  \n3. **Add it to your spellbook**; it becomes available for future preparation.  \n\n---\n\n## 7. Arcane Recovery (1st level)\n\n* **Once per day** after a **short rest**, you can recover spell slots.  \n* You may regain a total slot level equal to **⌈Wizard level / 2⌉** (rounded up).  \n  * At 1st level this is 1 slot (usually a 1st‑level slot).  \n* You can’t recover the same slot level twice in a day.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Arcane Traditions (2nd level)\n\nWhen you reach 2nd level, choose a **School of Magic** (e.g., Evocation, Illusion, Transmutation, etc.).  \nEach school gives you unique features that can alter:\n\n* **Casting style** (e.g., Evocation lets you ignore damage to allies).  \n* **New spell options** or bonuses (e.g., Arcane Sight, Sculpt Spells).  \n* **Special abilities** that improve spellcasting or give thematic benefits.  \n\n(There are many schools; check *Player’s Handbook* or *Xanathar’s Guide to Everything* for details.)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Spell Mastery (18th level)\n\n* **Choose one 1st‑level spell** and one **2nd‑level spell** you can now cast **at will**—without using a spell slot.  \n  * Common choices: *Magic Missile* (1st) and *Fireball* (2nd).  \n* You can cast those spells repeatedly, no limit.  \n* All other spells still use slots as usual.  \n* You can also gain **higher‑level spell slots** and the **maximum spell level** increases with your class level (10th‑level wizard can cast 5th‑level spells, 18th‑level wizard can cast 9th‑level spells).\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference Table (1st lvl Wizard)\n\n| Item | Value |\n|------|-------|\n| **Cantrips known** | 2 |\n| **1st‑level spells known** | 2 |\n| **Spellbook** | 6 × 1st‑level spells |\n| **Prepared** | 2 (Int + level) |\n| **Slots** | 2 × 1st |\n| **DC** | 8 + Prof + Int |\n| **Attack mod** | Prof + Int |\n| **Arcane Recovery** | 1 slot (1st‑lvl) |\n| **Ritual** | Yes, if spell has tag |\n| **Focus** | Component pouch / wand |\n| **Learn** | Copy from scroll/spellbook (1 h × lvl, 10 gp × lvl) |\n| **Arcane Tradition** | Choose at 2nd level |\n| **Spell Mastery** | At 18th: 1st‑ and 2nd‑level spells at will |\n\nThat’s the full picture for a beginner wizard.  Once you level up, the numbers scale up (more slots, higher‑level spells, new features), but the core mechanics stay the same.  Happy casting!", "reference": "Spellcasting is the way a wizard uses a spellbook to learn and cast spells. At 1st level you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list and you have a spellbook that contains six 1st‑level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook holds all the wizard spells you know, except for cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n\nYou prepare spells from your spellbook each day. The number of spells you can prepare equals your Intelligence modifier plus your wizard level (at least one spell). The spells you prepare must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, a 3rd‑level wizard has four 1st‑level and two 2nd‑level slots; with an Intelligence of 16 you can prepare six 1st‑ or 2nd‑level spells. Once prepared, a spell can be cast using a slot of its level or higher, and casting it does not remove it from your prepared list. You can change your prepared list when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\nYou regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. To cast a spell you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher.\n\nYour spellcasting ability is Intelligence. Use your Intelligence modifier when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC, and when making an attack roll. The formulas are:\n- Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.\n- Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.\n\nIf a spell has the ritual tag and you have it in your spellbook, you can cast it as a ritual without needing to have it prepared.\n\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n\nEach time you gain a wizard level you may add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free; each must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You may also add other spells you find to your spellbook.\n\nArcane Recovery lets you recover expended spell slots once per day after a short rest. You can recover slots whose combined level is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the recovered slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, a 4th‑level wizard can recover up to two levels worth of slots, such as one 2nd‑level slot or two 1st‑level slots.\n\nAt 2nd level you choose an arcane tradition, which grants you features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level. You can choose from eight schools of magic, such as Evocation.\n\nAt 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1 (but no score may exceed 20).\n\nAt 18th level you achieve Spell Mastery, allowing you to cast a chosen 1st‑level wizard spell at will.", "answer_relevancy": 0.7072878321076601, "semantic_similarity": 0.5661660875138427, "bleu_score": 0.0, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.24853801169590647, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.19630484988452657, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.3386454183266932}

You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.

You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook.

Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. Spellbook At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. Preparing and Casting Spells The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar). Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. Arcane Tradition When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. Signature Spells When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.

The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell.

Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. Spellbook At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. Preparing and Casting Spells The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. SpellsaveDC=8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spellattackmodifier=your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar). Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. Arcane Tradition When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Spell Mastery At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell", "<2-hop>\n\nand a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. Signature Spells When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. Arcane Traditions The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study. The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques. School of Evocation You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants. Evocation Savant Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved. Sculpt Spells Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. Potent Cantrip Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip. Empowered Evocation Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast. Overchannel Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. Your Spellbook The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. Copying a Spell into the Book.When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Replacing the Book.

Those excluded allies take **no damage**. This makes area spells safe around your party and lets you hit hard without harming friends. |\n| **10th** | **Potent Cantrip** | Any evocation cantrip that deals damage now deals **additional damage equal to your wizard level**. At 10th level a *fire bolt* becomes 1d10 + 10 damage; at 18th it becomes 1d10 + 18. |\n| **14th** | **Overchannel** | When you cast an evocation spell of **5th level or lower**, you can choose to *overchannel* it: the spell is treated as if it were one level higher, **but you take damage equal to the spell’s level**. This lets you cast powerful low‑level spells (e.g., *fireball*, *lightning bolt*, *cone of cold*) for free, at the cost of some of your own hit points. |\n| **Throughout** | **Synergy with Damage Spells** | Evocation wizards have a large repertoire of high‑damage spells (e.g., *fireball*, *cone of cold*, *chain lightning*, *sunburst*). The *Sculpt Spells* and *Potent Cantrip* features make those spells even more lethal in a team setting, while *Overchannel* keeps your spell slots available for more critical spells. |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Take‑away Summary\n\n1. **Copying evocation spells is cheaper and faster**—the gold and time costs are both halved.\n2. **Combat edge**:  \n   * *Sculpt Spells* lets you protect allies from your own damage.  \n   * *Potent Cantrip* turns your cantrips into powerful finishers.  \n   * *Overchannel* gives you free low‑level damage at a small HP cost.  \n3. **At higher levels** your evocation wizard becomes a “damage‑dealer with a safety net” – you can blast enemies hard while keeping friends safe, and you can manage your resources better thanks to the overchannel option.\n\nIf you have any other questions—e.g., about how *Sculpt Spells* interacts with concentration or specific spell combinations—feel free to ask!", "reference": "The evokation savnt featur, which you gain when you pick the evokation scholl at 2nd level, halves the gold and tme you must spend to cop an evokation spel into your spellbokk.

The evokation scholl also gives you a suite of combat‑focused abilities that grow with level. At 2nd level you get sculpt spels, letting you choose 1 + the spell’s level of affected creatures to automatically succeed on their saves and take no damage if they would normally take half damage. At 6th level you gain potent cantrip, so a creature that succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip takes half damage but no other effect. At 10th level you get empowered evokation, adding your Int modifier to one damage roll of any evokation spell. At 14th level you gain overchannel, allowing you to deal maximum damage with a 1st‑through‑5th‑level evokation spell; the first use is free, subsequent uses cost necrotic damage. These features make evokation wizrds especially powerful in combat, allowing them to blast enemies while protecting allies, and to maximize damage when needed.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book’s Appearance.

As a result, *the spell does not require any costly material components when you cast it*.  \n\n- **No change to the normal copying cost or time.**  \n  The spell still costs 50 gp per level (and 2 days per level) to copy into your spellbook. The feature does **not** reduce that 50 gp/level cost or the time required to copy the spell.  \n\n- **Can be applied to any spell, even if it’s not originally evocation.**  \n  You can choose to treat a spell you copy as evocation, even if the spell’s school is something else. Once treated as evocation, the material‑component cost is ignored whenever you cast that spell (but the spell’s school remains unchanged for other rules).\n\nIn short: *Evocation Savant* lets you ignore material component costs for the spell when you cast it, but it does not lower the 50 gp per level fee (or the time) for adding that spell to your spellbook.", "reference": "Evocation Savant is a feature you get when you pick the School of Evocation at 2nd level. It halves the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook. Normally copying a spell takes 2 hours per level and costs 50 gp per level. With Evocation Savant, those numbers are cut in half, so it takes 1 hour per level and costs 25 gp per level. To copy a spell you must first decipher its notation, practice the sounds or gestures, and then transcribe it into your own notation. You can only copy a spell if it is of a level you can prepare and if you have the time to do it. The wizard can also copy spells from their own spellbook into another book, which takes 1 hour and 10 gp per level, but that is not affected by Evocation Savant.", "answer_relevancy": 0.769770565624821, "semantic_similarity": 0.8617329044552291, "bleu_score": 0.1062348159602246, "rouge_L_f1(mode=fmeasure)": 0.24633431085043989, "rouge_L_precision(mode=precision)": 0.21761658031088082, "rouge_L_recall(mode=recall)": 0.28378378378378377}
